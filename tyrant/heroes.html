    <h3>Reputation and Renown: Villagers from Rosler's Coffer</h3>
    <div class="row">
      <section>
        <h2>Leader Details: Mayor Grive</h2>
        <p>A practical and no-nonsense politician, Mayor Grive has helped Roslar's Coffer survive hardship and rebuild by recognizing when to take action and when she's in over her head and taking the sensible approach until the proper authorities arrive.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Action Plan: Midsummer Pageant</h2>
        <p>The Seventh Day of Erastus is celebrated with a Midsummer Pageant by most hunting and farming villages and small towns throughout the Inner Sea, a holdover among the small communities of thanksgiving to Erastil even among nations where the worship of Erastil is largely forgotten or neglected. Roslar's Coffer is no exception, using the day to give thanksgiving to Old Deadeye, seeking his blessing on their hunts and harvests, and using the tradition as an excuss to take a break from the regular work in the fields. With their primary resource being flax, which is used to feed, build, and clothe the capital of Lastway, Vigil, the Midsummer Pageant is also a time of recognition for the people of Roslar's Coffer, a time where their efforts and contribution towards the nations common good is most recognized.</p>
        <p>The Midsummer Pageant has the whole town of Rosler's Coffer on display - the town square has been swept clean and filled with merchant's showcasing their best wares, carnival games for children and adults with prizes to be won, performances by aspiring bards and entertainers, brewmasters and bakers handing out samples of their creations, and militia keeping the crowds safe and civil. Tournaments are held in the flax fields where the seeds are germinating safely beneath the soil before the first few sprouts break the surface, giving a chance for people to demonstrate their various hunting skills through archery, falconry, fishing, peasant jousting, strength and skill, and tracking competitions. The Sarenite temple has all of their relics on display mixed in with local art, free food, professional bardic music echoing about the walls, and the clergy are freely offering blessings upon families, livestock, and crafts brought before them.</p>
        <p>The capstone on the pageant is in the offering given to Erastil by the town's mayor, Lady Milliana Grive, along with her public prayer to Erastil for a blessing on the towns work and harvest, Shelyn for healing and hope, Gorum for strength and valor, and Iomedae for protection and peace. The relic being presented this year is a treasure from Vigil - a piece of the <i>Shattered Shield of Arnisant</i>, the shield made and wielded by Aroden's own mortal hand when he slayed Tar-Baphon, the same shield wielded by General Arnisant when he rallied the faltering Shinning Crusade alongside and led even the mortal Iomedae against the Whispering Tyrant, and the same shield that destroyed that Tyrant's power when the risen lich used a wish to summon General Arnisant's heart into his hand only to be defeated by the shield's protective magic. With more than a thousand years of history and reverence, and with the shield being instrumental in the defeat of Tar-Baphon each time, this piece is a piece of history, of magic, of the power of gods, and of the reason for Lastwall's existence. It is an honor to see a piece with one's own eyes, and rummor has it that the winner of each of the Erastian Tournaments will have the priveledge of touching the piece personally.</p>

        <h3>The Artisan</h3>
        <img src="images/unknown.png" alt="unknown">
        <p><b>Description:</b> Precision is important in getting exactly what you want, and you give careful consideration in building everything from homes and vases to roads and empires. Your own attention to detail has proven vital in rebuilding Roslar’s Coffer from the orc occupation a decade ago, whether you are an accountant, architect, engineer, or herbalist.</p>
        <p><b>Bonus:</b> Your attention to detail provides you a +1 trait bonus on Appraise and Heal checks, and one of these skills becomes a class skill for you. Once per day, you can spend a full round casting a spell you can cast that has a normal casting time of 1 standard action to increase your effective caster level for that spell by 1. This ability has no affect on spells with a casting time other than 1 standard action.</p>
        <p><b>Occupation: </b>Construction Detail - Whether you're an accountant, architect, engineer, herbalist, or have a different profession, you have been very helpful in the reconstrcution efforts of Roslar's Coffer. Due to your skill and attention, you now find yourself helping with the design and implementation of current expansions while most of the other workers have either returned to the fields or else sought employment in Vigil. You gain 50gp in spending money at the start of the game.</p>
        <p><b>Family: </b>The stability and prosperity of your job has afforded you a small house and the time to settle down with a family. Whether you have been married for a long time or are currently engaged, you have a significant other with whom you are in love. You may or may not have children already, but either your significant other is with child or the two of you have recently adopted a baby.</p>
        <!--<p><b>Mythic: </b>Archmage - Since the explosion, whenever you close your eyes and try to calmly concentrate, you see a vast library of books, all plain and without any cover. Wandering the library with you are people shelving books, some of whom you recognize as your ancestors. You gain 3hp.</p>-->

      <section>
        <h3>The Lawbringer</h3>
        <img src="images/unknown.png" alt="unknown">
        <p><b>Description:</b> The frontier is a land of risk and disorder, and while people are welcome to brave those elements themselves, they all too often bring pain down upon folk who never wanted such a risk. You might serve on the town guard or as part of a detachment of soldiers supported by Vigil, or you could be simply a concerned farmer who endures when others cannot, but your purpose is to stand as a bulwark against the cruel whims of fate for anyone who needs it.</p>
        <p><b>Bonus:</b> You gain a +2 trait bonus on saving throws against fear effects. If you have the aura of courage class feature, the bonus provided by your aura increases by 1. Your courage is inspiring; the first time each day you are knocked unconscious or killed, all allies within 30 feet of you immediately gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your level plus your Charisma modifier, as they rally to your defense. These temporary hit points last for 1 minute.</p>
        <p><b>Occupation: </b>Militia - Whether you were a farmer, a town guard, or a soldier from Vigil, your base pay now stems from your work in Roslar's Militia and your defense of Roslar's Coffer. You gain 10gp in spending money at the start of the game as well as a masterwork light shield as part of your uniform.</p>
        <p><b>Family: </b>Whether you grew up here or not, your closest family are the brothers and sisters in arms you serve with. You have a best friend, a human named Jerod Catarina, that has been serving here as long as you. You and he may be in a budding relationship, but things haven't gotten serious yet, or you else your relationship may be completely platonic but no less deep. The two of you have been saving for months to get a small flat together and move out of the barracks.</p>
        <!--<p><b>Mythic: </b>Champion - You have always fallen back on your training in times of crisis, but didn't expect to see the training before you when you close your eyes. You see formations of hundreds of soldier's, brothers in arms, across centuries of armor and formation styles, all drilling and training together with impossibly perfect precision and cohesion. You gain 5hp.</p>-->

      <section>
        <h3>The Optimist</h3>
        <img src="images/unknown.png" alt="unknown">
        <p><b>Description</b> People don’t need to take your word that things are getting better; they only need to look around and see the proof before their eyes. The town’s recovery from the orc occupation more than a decade ago is all but complete, and the monster in the Sarenite temple outside of town has finally been bested. Your irrepressible sense of optimism seems to fly in the face of the hard life that most residents of Roslar’s Coffer face, but you’re convinced that your positive attitude lifts up your community.</p>
        <p><b>Bonus:</b> You gain a +1 trait bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects. Further, your optimism can be infectious. As a swift action a number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1), you can grant this bonus to an ally within 10 feet. This bonus lasts for 1 minute.</p>
        <p><b>Occupation: </b> have pursued both work and hobbies in equal measure since you found a burried cache of treasure while clearing away some rubble during the reconstruction a few years ago. You gain 1,000gp and five sets of fine clothing worth 50gp each at the start of the game.</p>
        <p><b>Family: </b> own a small manor house where you live with your family. Your living parents reside in the attached guest house, and you share your home with your spouse or significant other and two children. Alternatively, you could live here with your brother and his family.</p>
        <!--<p><b>Mythic: </b>Marshal - Your good luck and attitude have served you well so far, and they continue when you close your eyes. You see a thriving city, filled with happy people and music, when you close your eyes, each person trying to tell you a different story, though you can't seem to understand them. You gain 4hp.</p>-->

        <h3>The Outsider</h3>
        <img src="images/unknown.png" alt="unknown">
        <p><b>Description:</b> You don’t have a place, but the frontier seems comfortable enough for now. Maybe you’re too informal for city life, too selfish for Lastwall’s general culture of camaraderie, or too scarred by things you’ve seen to entirely trust another person.</p>
        <p><b>Bonus:</b> You are accustomed to moving without drawing much attention to yourself, gaining a +1 trait bonus on Stealth and Survival checks, and one of these skills is always a class skill for you. Accustomed to working alone, you gain only half the benefit (+1) from aid another actions, but you’re accustomed to doing the job right the first time and so increase the bonus you provide by 1 when aiding another character.</p>

        <h3>The Pessimist</h3>
        <img src="images/unknown.png" alt="unknown">
        <p><b>Description:</b> You expect the worst and have rarely been disappointed. Your dour outlook may hail from the original destruction of Roslar’s Coffer at the hands of the Twisted Nail tribe, the exile of the faithful from the nearby Sarenite temple, or some more personal misfortune, but it has set you apart among the largely forward-thinking population of Lastwall.</p>
        <p><b>Bonus:</b> Your faith that the worst possible outcome will occur grants you a +1 trait bonus on Will saving throws. Your frustrating pessimism can spur friends to succeed just to spite you; once per day as a free action, you can force an ally within 30 feet to reroll a saving throw she just failed, using the better of the two results.</p>

        <h3>The Reclaimer</h3>
        <img src="images/unknown.png" alt="unknown">
        <p><b>Description:</b> You lost something precious in the destruction of Roslar’s Coffer 12 years ago—a home, a legacy, perhaps even family—but returned because a soul shouldn’t run from pain, but heal from it. Rebuilding your life and preventing that same hurt from dragging down others drives you to serve and protect, perhaps as a politician, charity worker, healer, or soldier, but that same loss fills you with an uncharitable anger that is often difficult to reconcile.</p>
        <p><b>Bonus:</b> Your wary eyes grant you a +1 trait bonus on Perception checks. You gain a +1 trait bonus on attack and damage rolls against any opponent that dealt hit point damage to one of your allies in the previous round.</p>
        <p><b>Occupation: </b></p>
        <p><b>Family: </b></p>

        <h3>The Snoop</h3>
        <img src="images/unknown.png" alt="unknown">
        <p><b>Description:</b> You know a little bit about most everything and everyone in Roslar’s Coffer. It may be your profession, as you could be an archivist, crier, or librarian—or you simply make a hobby of gossip.</p>
        <p><b>Bonus:</b> Either way, you have a gift for recall and reading others. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Knowledge (history) and Knowledge (local) checks, and these both become class skills for you. Once each day you can reroll a single Bluff or Sense Motive check against a creature you have known for at least 24 hours, using the better result.</p>
        <p><b>Occupation: </b></p>
        <p><b>Family: </b></p>

        <h3>The Word</h3>
        <img src="images/unknown.png" alt="unknown">
        <p><b>Description:</b> In a nation overcrowded with faith, you often worry that your message is drowned out, but nonetheless important. The souls in Roslar’s Coffer needed comfort and charity once upon a time, but have bounced back so fully—in part thanks to your hard work—that you worry you’ve made yourself unnecessary.</p>
        <p><b>Bonus:</b> You are accustomed to long hours, granting you a +1 trait bonus on Fortitude saving throws. Your faith is invigorating, and once per day you can lay on hands as a paladin of half your character level (minimum 1). If you gain the lay on hands ability from a class, you instead gain one additional use of lay on hands each day.</p>
