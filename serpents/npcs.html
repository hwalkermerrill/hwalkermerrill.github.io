				<h3>Charau-Ka</h3>
				<strong>Expedition Leader: High Girallon Usaro</strong><br><br>
				<img src="/serpents/images/unknown.png" alt="placeholder">
				<p>Background: The feral charau-ka are the legendary ape-men of the Mwangi jungles. Savage and remorseless
					hunters, they are feared and hated by virtually every civilization that comes in contact with them. They build
					no cities, have next to no concept of trade, and make war on everyone that they encounter. They are thieves
					and murderers, killers in the dark. Most are servants of the dread Gorilla King and his demon patron,
					Angazhan, but even those tribes not under the sway of Usaro are considered monstrous. From Senghor to the
					mouth of the Black Flow, all wise folk agree that the charau-ka must be driven back into the deepest jungles,
					lest they overrun civilization and leave it as a burning sacrifice to their howling god.</p>
				<p>Objective: The Chief High Girallon, Gorilla King Ruthazek, wants relatively little, he simply desires to add
					the city of Saventh-Yhi to his kingdom, and enslave all the the men and mer within before moving on to
					Kalabuto and Sargava.</p>
				<p>Rival: Ruthazek believes that no grouping of man is worth considering a rival, they are too weak and
					short-lived to be any real concern.</p>
				<p>Secrets: ???</p>

				<h3>Gold Crown Shipping and Mining Company (G.C.S.)</h3>
				<strong>Expedition Leader: Earl Ortho Vibius <!--Krieve--></strong><br><br>
				<img src="/serpents/images/logo-gold-crown-shipping.jpg" alt="Gold Crown Logo">
				<p>Background: Although primarily known for hauling cargo between Port Freedom and Eleder, the G.C.S. originally
					made its profits from mining operations in the Bandu Hills. They ship everything valuable, from pineapples to
					gold, on their swift, well-armed barges and armored wagon trains, sometimes at a moment's notice. They've also
					proven willing to outfit and conduct expeditions into the dangerous interior of the Mwangi Expanse, and though
					many of these are forced to turn back with heavy losses, the dangerous missions bring in real money and never
					have a shortage of volunteers. While their veterans are expensive, they are the go-to contracts for Sargava in
					mapping out ruins and enemy territories, and their reports always prove to be 100% accurate.</p>
				<p>Objective: The wealthy noble, Ortho Vibius, regularly contracts expeditions by the GCS into the Mwangi
					interior, and is personally accompanying this expedition. While he intends to mine out gold and artifacts from
					the city to recover the cost of the expedition, his primary goal is to find the lost Sixth Army of
					Exploration, who supposedly found Saventh-Yhi before being annihilated. If the artifacts of those ancient
					explorers could be recovered, if the reach of their expedition could be proven, and if the remains of Grand
					Prince Cyricas and his legendary Worldbreaker could be recovered, it would be a priceless find, and it would
					be of immense value to the noble families of those explorers.</p>
				<p>Primary Rival: Vessels belonging to the G.C.S. are frequently prayed upon by the Rivermen's Guild, and the
					two have developed a survival instinct of attacking the other on sight.</p>
				<p>Route Resources: The G.C.S. has knowledge of and access to secret, underground tunnels, roads, and shortcuts.
					Roll 1d6 instead of 1d4 on shortcuts.</p>
				<p>Secrets: ???</p>
				<!-- <p>Secrets: Ortho Vibius is a member of the Kith, a network of Lion Blades affiliates. The Lion Blades have a
					controlling interest in G.C.S., and several prominent leadership positions are filled by lion blades and kith,
					like the Earl. The lion blades use the gold from their mines to fund their operations, while using the Earl to
					launder money gained on operation while simultaneously funding scouting and intelligence gathering missions.
					As the custodians for the Kithrodian Archives of the Taldan government, they are the rightful owners of the
					lost relics of "The Leaping Lion" Grand Prince Cyricus and the sixth army of exploration, and would see them
					returned safely to their museum.</p> -->
				<p>Signing Bonus: Gold is the best signing bonus, and each signatory gains an immediate payment of 500gp.</p>
				<p>Boon: Utilizes forward scouts to discover areas more easily, providing an additional +5 bonus on perception
					checks to discover new areas.</p>

				<h3>Ivory Cross</h3>
				<strong>Expedition Leader: Mister Dargan Etters <!--Commander Quilis Fortuna--></strong><br><br>
				<img src="/serpents/images/logo-ivory-cross.jpg" alt="Ivory Cross Logo">
				<p>Background: Sargava’s most organized guild, the Ivory Cross, began operations in Eleder only 30 years ago,
					but it has quickly established itself as a force to be reckoned with. Consisting of nearly a hundred mercenary
					soldiers and officers, all sporting the badge of their order, the Ivory Cross has a very visible presence in
					Eleder. While they regular escort expeditions into the Bandu Hills, they are not a treasure-hunting
					organization, instead they seek to maintain security and order. It is no secret that they desire an exclusive
					contract to serve as Sargava's standing army, or that the Grand Custodian is seriously considering the offer,
					though he fears that it would simply exchange one set of "protectors" for another. Especially with rumors from
					the interior suggesting the Ivory Cross uses violence and coercion to ensure cooperation, putting colonial
					ranches and Mwangi tribesmen to torch that refuse to grant favorable terms. </p>
				<p>Objective: The Ivory Cross has been hired by Dargan Etters as a business venture, viewing the legendary city
					of Saventh-Yhi as a way to make money, nothing more and nothing less. He intends to maximize profits,
					carefully selling everything worth carrying to select clientele - mostly wealthy private collectors - while
					limiting the sale rate to keep prices high and preserve the artifacts future value. He compensates his
					employees according to their results.</p>
				<p>Primary Rival: The Pathfinder Society and the Ivory Cross are often at odds with one another, undertaking
					similar, competing jobs while holding radically different values. This is yet another job where the two are
					competing, and its likely to be another bloody collision.</p>
				<p>Route Resources: The Ivory Cross treats land trade routes as highways.</p>
				<!-- <p>Secrets: ???</p> -->
				<p>Secrets: The Ivory Cross is a front for the Aspis Consortium, a way for the consortium to make money within
					sargava through mercenary contracts. As the consortiums operations are heavily sanctioned within Sargava, this
					is a closely guarded secret, though those in the know are often powerless to do anything about it - the Ivory
					Cross is perhaps the only effective mercenary militia in the country; its too powerful to stop.</p>
				<p>Signing Bonus: A selection of scrolls, potions, and wands worth 500gp per person.</p>
				<p>Boon: The Ivory Cross grants +5 bonus on diplomacy checks to secure alliances or trade routes.</p>

				<h3>Pathfinder Society</h3>
				<strong>Expedition Leader: Pathfinder Amivor Glaur <!--Venture-Captain Finze Bellaugh>--></strong><br><br>
				<img src="/serpents/images/logo-pathfinder-society-sargava.jpg" alt="Pathfinder Logo">
				<p>Background: A loose-knit group of explorers, archeologists, and adventurers, the Pathfinder Society searches
					the globe for lost knowledge and ancient treasures. Many of the greatest explorers of the modern age were
					members of this prestigious society, telling often unbelievable tales of discovery and ruin. While an honest
					desire to unlock history';s secrets motivates some Pathfinders, the promise of material fortune and fame
					propels others, who seek a sort of immortality in the publications of the Society, while still other
					Pathfinders take up the trade out of the simple thrill for perilous adventure.</p>
				<p>Objective: The Pathfinder Society seeks Saventh-Yhi for the same reason they explore any other ancient ruin —
					for the lost knowledge it contains, not to mention the historical artifacts and rumored wealth that can be
					recovered from the fabled city. In addition, with the recent loss of their lodge in the city of Kalabuto, the
					Decemvirate is eager to expand their influence in the region, and Saventh-Yhi might just make a good site for
					a new Pathfinder Lodge.</p>
				<p>Primary Rival: The Pathfinder Society and the Ivory Cross are often at odds with one another, undertaking
					similar, competing jobs while holding radically different values. This is yet another job where the two are
					competing, and its likely to be another bloody collision.</p>
				<p>Route Resources: The Pathfinder Society can cross through settlements and ruins at 2x speed.</p>
				<p>Secrets: ???</p>
				<!-- <p>Secrets: Venture-Captain Finze Bellaugh believes theres more to the city than just wealth and lost knowledge.
					Yes, they hope the venture will bring fortune and archeological discovery, but they believe Saventh-Yhi may
					hold the key to locating other ancient cities and relics; particularly, they have reason to believe that
					old-mage Jatembe may have visited the ancient city shortly after the age of darkness, and legendary
					pathfinders have tried and failed to follow his footsteps. This is a chance to travel a path not walked in
					millennia, and the lost knowledge and fame that could be found along that path is priceless.</p> -->
				<p>Signing Bonus: Field commissions to Pathfinders, granting Society membership complete with <i>Wayfinders</i>
					embedded with an ioun stone of their choice worth up to 400gp. This also paves the way for access to future
					PRCs.</p>
				<p>Boon: The Pathfinder Society is quite adept at exploration, gaining a +4 to exploration checks.</p>

				<h3>Red Mantis</h3>
				<strong>Expedition Leader: Mistress Chivane <!--Blood Mistress Jakalyn--></strong><br><br>
				<img src="/serpents/images/logo-red-mantis.jpg" alt="Red Mantis Logo">
				<p>Background: The Red Mantis are the most tenacious and efficient assassins the world has ever known. They
					usually kill their victims with a sacred saw-toothed sabre, so victims often drown in their own blood before
					their hearts cease beating. No palace, fortress, safe house, or cavern is secure enough to keep out the Red
					Mantis. And no matter how wealthy or powerful they were, victims of the Red Mantis stay dead - no matter what.
					As reliable as they are, even the most desperate plotters think twice before calling on the Red Mantis. One
					never knows what price they will ask - it varies widely based on the client and target - but it is always
					nonnegotiable. While they take on almost any job, they do have one unbreakable rule: they do not commit
					regicide against a rightfully sitting monarch.</p>
				<p>Objective: The Red Mantis are not necessarily interested in the city of Saventh-Yhi itself, but what is
					rumored to lie inside it. Ancient texts hint at the existence of a temple to Achaekek the Mantis God within
					the legendary city, and the Red Mantis are eager to find this location, which is sacred to their cult. Within
					the lost temple, they hope to find powerful relics of the Mantis God unseen on Golarion since the days of
					Azlant, including the head of an assassinated god. They intent to kill anyone who trespasses on this holy
					site, keeping the location of Saventh-Yhi a closely-guarded secret.</p>
				<p>Primary Rival: The Sargavan Custodial Government has no patience for Red Mantis Assassins, and while they
					wish to reach the Saventh-Yhi first, they know they can at least tax the others' findings; but Red Mantis is
					beholden to no one else, and only nations can compete with their power.</p>
				<p>Route Resources: Particularly good at sabotage and assassination, the Red Mantis can sabotage two groups at a
					time when performing sabotage missions, and can always sabotage whomever is in the lead. Their sabotage
					opportunities can never backfire.</p>
				<p>Secrets: ???</p>
				<!-- <p>Secrets: The red mantis are an organization of secrets, and they have none to share.</p> -->
				<p>Signing Bonus: The Red Mantis provide each signatory with 500gp worth of poisons, antitoxins, and healer's
					kits, as well as association with the Red Mantis, potentially opening up future PRCs.</p>
				<p>Boon: They gain a free condition (sow terror) to conquer each district within Saventh-Yhi</p>

				<h3>Rivermen's Guild</h3>
				<strong>Expedition Leader: Captain Kassata Lewynn <!--Maximilia--></strong><br><br>
				<img src="/serpents/images/logo-rivermens-guild.jpg" alt="Rivermen Logo">
				<p>Background: A coalition of barge sailors working along the Korir river, open to anyone who makes their living
					on the waterways, only those who actually own or operate a barge is allowed to hold one of the five voting
					seats in the Rivermen's Guild. While obviously not an entirely fair system, the people of Port Freedom know
					better than to speak openly of it, as it's an open secret that the Rivermen's Guild is just a collection of
					thugs, robbers, and thieves. Ruthless businessmen known to steal, sink, and hijack the cargo of non-guild
					members (chiefly those belonging to G.C.S.), many of their number are simply relatively-honest businessmen and
					workers, paying for membership to avoid being a target, and speaking only good of the organization who takes a
					dim view of careless talk. Several Grand Custodians have attempted to disband the Rivermen's Guild and arrest
					its leaders, but none have managed it, with guards generally refusing to arrest guild members for feat of
					their families safety.</p>
				<p>Objective: Captain Kassata Lewynn of the <i>Last Hurrah</i>, and member of the Free Captains Alliance, has
					struck a deal with the Rivermen's Guild for use of their barges and knowledge of the waterways to reach
					Saventh-Yhi. While the exact details of the arrangement are private, what has emerged is a small fleet of
					river barges crewed by pirates and led by experienced navigators. Captain Lewynn hopes to recover enough
					treasure from the city to buy the allegiance of several pirate lords so she can make herself the Hurricane
					King, folding the Rivermen into the Free Captains in the process.</p>
				<p>Primary Rival: Vessels belonging to the G.C.S. are frequently prayed upon by the Rivermen's Guild, and the
					two have developed a survival instinct of attacking the other on sight.</p>
				<p>Route Resources: Highly experienced at getting underway quickly, the Rivermen's Guild moves twice as far as
					other groups along rivers and waterways on the same day they embark.</p>
				<p>Secrets: ???</p>
				<!-- <p>Secrets: See skulls and shackles to find out what secrets should go here.</p> -->
				<p>Signing Bonus: Captain Lewynn offers signatories either a small crew of able-bodied buccaneers, or up to
					500gp worth of guns, powder, and shot.</p>
				<p>Boon: The Rivermen's Guild is well stocked, gaining a +4 to supply and supply checks.</p>

				<h3>Sargavan Custodial Government</h3>
				<strong>Expedition Leader: General Rotilius Havelar <!--Grand Custodian Utilinus--></strong><br><br>
				<img src="/serpents/images/logo-sargava-custodial-government.jpg" alt="Sargavan Government Logo">
				<p>Background: Beset by devil-binding pilgrims and inescapable debts to pirate lords, as well as generations of
					resentment from the nation’s subjugated indigenous peoples, the colony of Sargava remains a bastion of
					northern culture and civilization in the heart of the southern wilds. Financially weakened by the Free
					Captains’ high demands and cut off from many of their former trade partners to the north, Sargava faces an
					even larger threat from within. The native Mwangi people, inspired by the teachings of a mysterious, undead
					child-god in the nearby city-state of Mzali, move ever closer to open rebellion to free themselves from
					colonial rule. While Cheliax no longer has an official stake in Sargava’s government, the colonial Sargavan
					minority maintains control of the vastly larger native population. But the natives know that they have the
					resources of the entire Mwangi Expanse at their backs, and that Grand Custodian Utilinus’s government is in a
					poor position to quell a rebellion.</p>
				<p>Objective: The Sargavan government wants to stake a claim on Saventh-Yhi for two reasons. First, if they can
					establish an outpost there, it increases their presence and influence in the region, while at the same time
					denying the same benefits to rivals. Second, the city’s legendary wealth and the opportunity to open new trade
					routes would go a long way toward refilling Sargava’s depleted treasury, perhaps granting the former colony a
					greater independence from (or at least less reliance on) the Free Captains of the Shackles. This could be just
					the opportunity Sargava needs to throw off their shackles, or conversely, it could be its last chance to avoid
					complete collapse under the weight of its obligations.</p>
				<p>Primary Rival: The Sargavan Custodial Government has no patience for Red Mantis Assassins, and while they
					wish to reach the Saventh-Yhi first, they know they can at least tax the others' findings; but Red Mantis is
					beholden to no one else, and only nations can compete with their power.</p>
				<p>Route Resources: The Sargavan Custodial Government can force certain people to provide shelter and lodging
					while turning others away, opening up more safe places to rest and re-supply on the way to Saventh-Yhi.</p>
				<!-- <p>Secrets: ???</p> -->
				<p>Secrets: Out of money, the Sargavan Custodial Government cannot afford any more payments to the Hurricane
					King. This expedition may be their last chance, as they will be defaulting on their next payment to the
					pirates. Even if they had the money to pay them, they need it to pay off several independence factionalists
					who are threatening to break away from the colony and start a war for independence. Infrastructure is
					crumbling, the army is severely underpaid, people are angry. Change is coming, one way or another, but
					Saventh-Yhi is an opportunity for that change to be good.</p>
				<p>Signing Bonus: They promise a noble title and a tract of land for each person, if they successfully manage to
					claim Saventh-Yhi first. They also offer each npc a personal guard or servant.</p>
				<p>Boon: The sargavan military troops provide encampments with +4 defense.</p>

				<h3>Bekyar Raiders</h3>
				<strong>Leader: None</strong><br><br>
				<figure class="two-three">
					<img src="/serpents/images/tribe-bekyar.png" alt="Bekyar Tribesman">
				</figure>
				<p>Bekyar tend to be tall, and their hairstyles often involve long and elaborate braids, sometimes
					incorporating silk headwraps. The majority of the Bekyar peoples hunt for game and raid other communities
					for food, resources, and - most importantly - people. What they do with their captives varies by tribe,
					which tend to fall under one of two subcategories:</p>
				<ul style="list-style-type: lower-greek;">
					<li><i>Bandu -</i> These slavers infest the Bandu Hills, which are in turn named
						after this tribe, turning an already dangerous and hostile area into one fraught with enough peril that
						few brave the territory, despite the promised riches. Much of their civil dealings with outsiders is
						limited to human trafficking - either buying a slave or a captives freedom. Since the colonization of
						Sargava, they have come to view the light-skinned foreigners as emissaries of the "northern gods," and
						as such they particularly prize these captives as sacrifices to their nature spirit deities.</li>
					<li><i>Yemba -</i> The Yemba are a smaller tribe rarely encountered by colonists
						but often spoken of in ghost stories as they are, if accounts are accurate, cannibals. The Yemba (whose
						name translates to ghoul) supposedly live along the River of Lost Tears and its many tributaries, and
						can be found by following the sounds of beating drums deep in the dark forests at night, where they can
						be encountered feasting upon human flesh in a ritual presided over by witch doctors known only as the
						"Yemba-bo" or "Ghoul-talkers".</li>

				<figure class="two-three">
					<img src="/serpents/images/tribe-bonuwat.png" alt="Bonuwat Tribesman">
				</figure>
				<p>Bonuwat mostly appear along the coastline and are typically shirtless, sometimes wearing paint instead of
					cloth, and they usually keep their hair cropped short, in cornrows, or shaved for the sake of being
					hydrodynamic. The Bonuwat have a seafaring heritage, and their communities pop up everywhere both water and
					fish can be found. These people tend to fall under one of two subcategories:</p>
				<ul style="list-style-type: lower-greek;">
					<li><i>Ijo -</i> Perhaps the friendliest of the local tribes, the Ijo spend their
						days on the open waters. Their tendency to dress in little more than loincloths is a source of
						embarrassment to some of the more genteel colonials, but it is a matter of simplicity to the Ijo who
						spend most of their time either in or on the water under the hot sun. They sell their daily catch all
						across Sargava and maintain cordial relations with most colonials and tribespeople, keeping their
						clashes on and under the sea.</li>
					<li><i>Ombo -</i> These merchants have loosely aligned themselves with the pirates
						of the Shackles and have adopted much of their sense of style, often wearing loose-fitting pantaloons
						and jewelry, and little else. They have found the slave trade to be particularly lucrative, often
						trading captives with the Free Captains on behalf of the Bandu, and occasionally preying upon the Ijo
						when they're found alone in open water.</li>

				<h3>Brotherhood of Cheerful Service</h3>
				<strong>Leader: None</strong><br><br>
				<figure class="two-three">
					<img src="/serpents/images/unknown.png" alt="placeholder">
				</figure>
				<p>A noble order of mwangi elves and magical beasts, this dragon-led brotherhood is dedicated to safeguarding
					impoverished villages from the dangers of the Expanse, including disease, famine, pestilence, and wild
					animals. Each dragon within the order takes on the role of a guardian and mentor, providing protection and
					carrying out acts of kindness. While most recipients are grateful for the aid, there have been many terrible
					misunderstandings; while a village will not turn away a gift of food (needed or not), especially when given by
					a dragon, they are frequently annoyed when dragons kill their herds to protect them from "being overrun by
					wild beast," or when a magical beast replaces their food-store with lizards in the belief that the lizards are
					more nutritious.</p>

				<figure class="two-three">
					<img src="/serpents/images/tribe-caldaru.png" alt="Caldaru Tribesman">
				</figure>
				<p>With skin tones ranging from olive to dark bronze, the Caldaru dress in long, flowing robes that take in the
					breeze and cool the skin. Believing themselves to be the chosen people, the majority of their people were
					enslaved or dispersed when outsiders first reached the Mwangi Expanse. Rather than assimilating, they have
					absorbed much of the knowledge of these far-flung communities while maintaining their identity, setting up
					their own communities to trade and sell their expertise. These diaspora congregate close to one-another
					wherever they are found, looking forward to one day establishing a kingdom in a city of their own.</p>

				<h3>Colonial Settlers</h3>
				<strong>Leader: Grand Custodian Utilinus</strong>
				<figure class="two-three">
					<img src="/serpents/images/tribe-sargavan.png" alt="Colonial Settler">
				</figure>
				<p>These people are descended from Chelish colonists, but were born and raised in Sargava, it being the only
					country and culture they know. While the culture and traditions of the inner sea are dominant amongst them,
					their style and lifestyle are shaped by their new environment. Many colonial natives speak polyglot (though it
					would be scandalous if they couldn't also speak proper common), and some have incorporated local religious
					adaptations into their own beliefs. Generations ago, it was disgraceful to intermix with the local Mwangi, but
					today intermarriages are not looked down upon, only uncommon, and multi-toned children join their fair-skinned
					families in the upper-crust of society.</p>

				<p>Not much is known of this strange organization - only a few months ago, none had seen a serpentfolk in
					millennia; this secretive society keeps its goals and aims to itself, not sharing information with outsiders
					they consider beneath them. However, the name and iconography suggest they are dedicated to the long-dead god
					of the serpentfolk, Ydersius, and believe they somehow draw power from its severed skull.</p>

				<h3>Cult of the Mantis <i>(heresy)</i></h3>
				<strong>Master Lessikal</strong>
				<figure class="two-three">
					<img src="/serpents/images/unknown.png" alt="placeholder">
				</figure>
				<p>The temple district is controlled by a tribe of troglodytes who have chosen an unusual deity to worship - the
					mantis god Achaekek. Unlike the Red Mantis assassins, who venerate this deity as a paragon of assassins, the
					Cult of the Mantis troglodytes worship him in much more the way the ancient Azlanti did - as a god of
					monsters, natural disasters, and blood. The troglodytes see themselves as the proper rulers of Saventh-Yhi,
					but their chaotic nature has made it difficult for their leaders to organize them into a force capable of
					doing more than tormenting their boggard neighbors in the farming district to the west.</p>

				<h3>Followers of the Sacred Serpent</h3>
				<strong>Leader: Snake-Tongued Osond</strong><br><br>
				<figure class="two-three">
					<img src="/serpents/images/unknown.png" alt="placeholder">
				</figure>
				<p>The ancient district of art and artisans is controlled by an isolated tribe of Caldaru who call themselves
					the Followers of the Sacred Serpent. These men and woman view sculpture as the highest form of art, and art as
					the purest form of worship, taking particular care to preserving the ancient stonework of the district. They
					both love and fear the servitor of their deity, a being known amongst them as the Radiant Muse, whom acts as
					the spiritual guide for their tribe, though they rarely pay it a visit outside of their scheduled holy days,
					and naver without tribute.</p>
				<p>Secrets: The chief and some of the tribes warriors have Taldan ancestors; stories of a group of powerful
					soldiers with marble skin, blue eyes, and golden hair protected their tribe from attacks by Charau-Ka, with
					few survivors. Among those that survived, most ventured back into the jungle to return home, with an unknown
					fate, but some stayed and their blood mingled with their own, making their chiefs stronger than a regular man.

				<h3>Freemen's Brotherhood</h3>
				<strong>Leader: None</strong><br><br>
				<figure class="two-three">
					<img src="/serpents/images/logo-freemens-brotherhood.jpg" alt="logo Freemen">
				</figure>
				<p>A loose association of mwangi natives led by ex-slaves, the Freemen's Brotherhood is a radical abolitionist
					group. Their primary goal is to instill terror in the hears of foreigners, merchants, and any others they
					believe stand behind the slave trade. Some adherents go so far as to view all colonials as "Imperialist
					Thieves" responsible fo rall their ills, and will not rest until every foreigner is killed or expelled from
					their land.</p>
				<p>Prone to violence and easy to incite, the lack of formal structure and quick anger towards law enforcement
					makes this group difficult to control, as vandalism from a member can quickly turn to violence, especially if
					the Sargavan Guard attempts to arrest anyone involved. Reactions from the Mwangi Natives to policy decisions
					have frequently led to riots, and the lack of any one leader makes them impossible to negotiate with.</p>

				<p>The Mauxi typically wear head wraps to protect themselves from the sun while favoring a variety of colorful
					robes and textiles. These people are typically nomadic and peaceful, but ready to defend themselves. The
					mauxi are further subcategorized by the heard animals they follow across the expanse, with the following two
					being predominant:</p>
				<ul style="list-style-type: lower-greek;">
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Bas'o -</i> These Mauxi follow the antelope heard in and out of Sargava, not
						caring for the borders drawn by the colonials anymore than the herds mind them. While peaceful, they
						have learned to be distrustful of strangers, and are not to be trifled with, having a deeply ingrained
						warrior culture ready to react violently to perceived challenges or threats.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Elephant People -</i> Scattered groups of nomads living alongside their
						elephant companions, these groups are collectively known as the elephant people. While not numerous,
						their incorporation of mighty elephant cavalry alongside ivory spears make them dangerous to challenge.
						The communities have themselves forgotten their ancestral name, having thought of themselves as
						"elephants in man-skin" for generations.</li>

				<h3>Order of the Coil</h3>
				<strong>Leader: Lictor Vitova Racnhe</strong><br><br>
				<figure class="two-three">
					<img src="/serpents/images/logo-order-of-the-coil.jpg" alt="Logo Order of the Coil">
				</figure>
				<p>Partially at the request of Chelish settlers in Sargava, the Order of the Pyre sought to establish a Garundi
					headquarters near the nation’s capital, Eleder. In 4694 AR, nearly 200 Hellknights landed in Sargava and set
					to work constructing the fortress of New Krane and oppressing the faiths of the land’s tribal peoples. Within
					a year, though, the native residents retaliated, and more than half of the Hellknights were slaughtered. With
					the commanding paralictor slain, the majority of the surviving Hellknights retreated, abandoning Sargava
					entirely. Those who stayed behind took inspiration from the deadly vipers of the region and styled themselves
					as the Order of the Coil.</p>
				<p>Now among the vilest of Hellknights, the Order of the Coil claims to be following the charge that originally
					brought the Order of the Pyre to Sargava. Destructive in the extreme, though, the order seeks to wipe out all
					evidence of Sargava’s native cultures. Under the command of the now-self-proclaimed Lictor Racnhe, the order’s
					roughly 60 mostly lawful evil members employ fire and poison to destroy Mwangi settlements and historical
					sites. </p>
				<p>Aside from targeting the native peoples of western Garund, the Order of the Coil also strikes against
					archaeologists, explorers, and traders who would spread word of the indigenous cultures and their wonders to
					the outside world.</p>

				<p>The agricultural district has become a swamp land — perfect for the tribe of boggards that controls the
					region. Normally proud and strong, they are in an unusually weak position since the disappearance of their
					spiritual guide (a fact they are sure one of the other tribes are responsible for). Now they cannot perform
					the proper rituals to appease their god, nor can they maintain or repair the wards that protect them if they
					fail. Worried for their tribe, territory, and souls, they have become desperate - a fact that makes them both
					pliable and unpredictable, compliant and dangerous.

				</figure>
				<p>The primary inhabitants of the dreaming jungle that dominates the former residential district is a sizable
					tribe of vegepygmies. These vegepygmies regard the immense colony of russet mold that grows upon the sheltered
					lower reaches of this district’s ziggurat as holy and sacred. It is difficult - though not impossible - to
					reason with creatures made from mold, though it is possible they regard humanoids the same way.</p>

				<h3>Zenj Peoples</h3>
				<strong>Leader: None</strong><br><br>
				<figure class="two-three">
					<img src="/serpents/images/tribe-zenj.png" alt="Zenj Tribesman">
				</figure>
				<p>While closely related and sharing many customs, the Zenj are clearly divided between the matriarchal
					savannah dwelling Zenje and the patriarchal jungle dwelling Zenju. Despite their differences, the Zenj
					typically see themselves as one people who happen to be living in different communities, and they often
					trade freely, celebrate together, and even come to one another's defense or aid, though they rarely
					inter-marry due to cultural differences regarding gender. Legend says that long ago they were one tribe when
					a patriarch who was afraid of hunting a predator insisted that a vegetarian diet was far healthier, causing
					the two groups to split. While pronounced the same, the details of these two subcategories are as follows:</p>
				<ul style="list-style-type: lower-greek;">
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Zenje -</i> The semi-nomadic matriarchs of the savannah, these people move
						between settlements they have constructed that they only occupy for a few months at a time, following
						the herds of their prey. The most popular Zenje fashions incorporate animal skins, with rarer animals
						denoting ones status.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Zenju -</i> The highly stationary patriarchs of the jungle, these people
						live in long homes and live an agricultural lifestyle. They tend to wear simple textiles and are well
						known for medicinal herbs, making them tempting targets for Bekyar raiders, and for knowing how to
						safely cook foods that are ordinarily poisonous - often morbidly joking with outsiders about the chefs
						lack of skills while they dine on the ordinarily-deadly meals. </li>

					accessed tools, and every piece of his clothing has utility.</p>
				<p>Background: A veteran of several expeditions into the Mwangi interior, Amivor is skilled at organizing an
					leading such missions, as well as appraising and exploring historical sites. He has been somewhat hardened and
					made more wild by all his time in the jungle, and has come to generally prefer being in the field to the noise
					of civilization.</p>
				<!-- <p>Boon: Amivor shares some of his skill with disabling traps; Everyone gains the ability to make a thrilling
					escape, once per day; pathfinder delvers may instead use their thrilling escape ability one additional time
					per day. Thrilling escape: When you trigger a trap via a failed disable device check, you may attempt a
					disable device check against its normal DC as an immediate action; if you succeed, the trap is not triggered
					until the end of your turn. Additionally, Amivor will vouch for the explorers, enabling the players to qualify

				</figure>
				<p>Appearance: Startlingly pretty, Chiva&ntilde;e takes the rare approach of removing her mask of the red
					mantis, allowing her to be recognized. This is likely due to the reality of leading an expedition of several
					assassins, rather than merely being on a job, but this decision enables the expedition leader to be recognized
					on sight at a distance.</p>
				<p>Background: [REDACTED]</p>
				<!-- <p>Boon: Mistress Chiva&ntilde;e will accept their pledges to the mantis god, enabling the players to take the

				<p>Appearance: Well adapted to the hot climate of the expanse, Patron Etters wears lose fitting and unrestricted
					clothing decorated in gold. He rarely ventures anywhere without his bodyguards, but his demeanor makes it
					clear that in any conversation, he is always the most important, powerful, and dangerous man in the room.</p>
				<p>Background: A charismatic businessman, Patron Etters is solely interested in his own wealth and prestige.
					Based out of Blood Cove, he rose to upper echelons of a society built on subterfuge and skullduggery. Arrogant
					and utterly ruthless, he has a reputation for maximizing profits at the expense of lives; having no qualms
					about killing people in his way, either to lessen competition or to get what he wants.</p>
				<!-- <p>Boon: Patron Etters pays well for loyalty. In addition to offering them a letter of introduction for the

					partying, Kassata lives a one-life-one-shot mantra, never letting an opportunity for fun or adventure pass
					idly by.</p>
				<p>Background: Captain of the <i>Last Hurrah</i>, Kassata Lewynn is an ambitious Free Captain of the Shackles.
					She craves authority and the admiration of her fellow captains, something she somewhat-rightfully believes can
					only be bought, and she will pursue fortune and glory with every drop of her blood.</p>
				<!-- <p>Boon: Kassata Lewynn offers some dueling instruction, teaching everyone the Classic Duelist pirate trick: You

				<p>Appearance: Middle aged and mildly foppish, His Honorable Lordship Vibius is a confirmed old bachelor
					possessing both wealth and station. At all times, he is dressed impeccably and acts with decorum, though he
					imperiously eyes the jungle with a combination of fright and disgust. His nobility has afforded him a
					fantastic and diverse education at colleges across Avistan, yet he retains an insatiable curiosity for the
					unknown, often asking pointed questions after concluding with pleasantries.</p>
				<p>Background: The largest benefactor to the G.C.S., Earl Vibius typically pays them enough money to operate for
					a year in exchange for brief explorations of the Stasis Fields in th Bandu Hills, though he doesn't seem to do
					anything with the reports that return to him. Not a field man, he is funding the expedition entirely out of
					his own pocket, purely for the pursuit of knowledge, of course.</p>
				<!-- <p>Boon: Ortho Vibius studied the bold fighting style of Grand Prince Cyricas, and teaches everyone how to

				<p>Background: Appointed to lead the expedition to Saventh-Yhi by Grand Custodian Utilinus, Rotilius Havelar is

				<!-- <p>Boon: The general is an excellent teacher, granting skill focus as a bonus feat in either Intimidate, Ride,

					dresses in tightly fitted leather armor and favors dark clothing and tricorn hats.</p>
				<p>Background: Aerys Mavato boarded the <i>Jenivere</i> at Port Peril, and immediately got in a fight with one
					of the ship’s crewmen when he made an ill-advised suggestion that he and Aerys could share bunks. Aerys
					soundly humiliated the crewman in the resulting scrap (much to the barely hidden delight of the

					brooding half-elf into a self imposed isolation in her forward cabin where she spent much of her time

				<p>Appearance: Ishirou is a rugged Tian man who appears much older than he is, with graying hair worn in a
					ponytail and a perpetual scruffy beard. His clothing and armor are well kept and clean, but obviously of low
					quality. Only his sword, a beautiful katana
					<!--given to him by a member of the Aspis Consortium to ensure his loyalty (and to increase the perceived debt he owes the group)-->,
					has any real value. Ishirou is rightfully protective of it, as it is his only material link to his cultural
					heritage.
				</p>
				<p>Ishirou grew up on his father’s ship, but grew to resent what he felt was a stolen childhood — he saw how
					those who stayed in one location set down roots, grew rich, and established empires. In a foolish attempt to
					force his family to settle down, young Ishirou stole down to the waterfront and lit his father’s ship on fire,
					only to watch in horror and shame as his father heroically leapt aboard the ship and tried to save it. His
					father died in the fire, and Ishirou’s secret drove him to stow away on an Aspis Consortium ship bound for
					Bloodcove. Ten years have passed since then, and Ishirou has worked as a sailor, thug, messenger, soldier, and
					guard for the Aspis Consortium the entire time. He boarded the Jenivere at Bloodcove, having finally paid off
					his debt to the Consortium, and is eager to seek a new life in Sargava.</p>
				<!-- <p>Quest: Ishirou admits that he collects treasure maps, and while most are of places he'd never dream of
					visiting or have proven to be of dubious origin, one of them shows the location of an old pirate's stash here

				<p>Background: A prisoner loaded at Corentyn, this man is bound and sequestered in the brig. Jask was once
					employed by the Sargavan government, but when he uncovered evidence of corruption involving illicit deals with
					the Free Captains of the Shackles, Jask confronted his superior, only to be betrayed and framed for the same

					for a decade. He’d thought his enemies in Sargava had forgotten him, but then a Sargavan agent caught up with
					him and put him in irons. The agent handed Jask over to the captain of the Jenivere with instructions to
					return Jask to Sargava for trial, but the captain disappeared during the shipwreck, leaving Jask alive but
					bound.</p>
				<!-- <p>Quest: One of the incriminating papers he found so long ago indicated that one of his superior’s contacts in
					the Shackles was a man named Avret Kinkarian. Kinkarian’s ship, the Brine Demon, reputedly wrecked here on

					off her skin, never removing her thick layers even when working under the hot son. Despite this, she has never
					been seen sweating or complaining about the heat, and those who assume she is frail have never seen her
					wrestle a bull into its pen.</p>
				<p>Background: A Vidric native, Mindra was born and raised in freehold after the traditions of her noble family.
					A champion of Mwangi rights, her large ranch is the halfway-point between the capital city of Eleder on the
					west coast, and the great city of Kalabuto on the edge of the eastern frontier. More than just a hard worker
					and leader, she is a cunning politician who defends the heartlands of the nation with her own well-armed
					shepherd and ranch-hands.</p>
				<p>Quest: The Skipper's Quest will be revealed at a later point in the journey.</p>

				<h3>Nkechi "The Tempest"</h3>
				<strong class="spiritBlack" style="color: crimson">Cranky Crab</strong><br><br>

					<img src="/serpents/images/totem-giant-crab.jpg" alt="The Cranky Crab" class="appearOnHover">
				</figure>
				<p>Appearance: The tempest eschews wearing shirts, and his single pair of trousers is heavily worn and patched,
					looking ragged from its constant exposure to the elements. In likewise fashion, his hair, beard, and eyebrows
					are permanently storm-strewn and loosing color at the ends, while he is clearly blind out of his left eye.
					Despite this, he bears a fine holy symbol of his patron in traditional construction, and he always wears a
					pair of sturdy shoes.</p>
				<p>Background: An aged shaman of Shimye-Magalla, the man born named Nkechi is called "The Tempest" by the
					Vidric natives of Eleder. Knowledgeable and wise, he is also temperamental and, like his patron, prone to fits
					of rage and seeming madness. Over the years, hundreds have come to him seeking guidance, and his counsel has
					earned him both parishioners and angry enemies. Having now survived several attempts on his life, he has
					developed a healthy sense of paranoid vigilance.</p>
				<p>Boon: The Tempest's can create powerful drugs that enable the adventurers to go on spirit journeys.</p>
				<p>Upgraded Boon: The Tempest's full powers are not yet realized, and remain mysterious, even to himself.</p>

				<h3><!--"Poor"--> Pezock "Crow Tooth"</h3>
				<!-- <strong>Boarded at Mediogalti</strong><br><br> -->
				<strong>G.C.S.</strong><br><br>
				<!-- <strong class="spiritBlack" style="color: #808000">Olive Scorpion</strong><br><br> -->
				<figure class="multiImage">
					<img src="/serpents/images/npc-pezock.png" alt="Pezock">
				</figure>
				<p>Appearance: This mad black tengu has seen too many days marooned on <i>Smuggler's Shiv</i>, and the
					combination of heat and isolation has taken its toll. He wears ragged pants and strips of white cloth bandaged
					around parts of his head, forearms, and tarses' in an effort to keep cool while covering small bites, cuts,
					and caught hooks.</p>
				<p>Background: Pezock is the only survivor of the wreckage of the <i>Crow's Tooth</i>, which wrecked on the
					shores of <i>Smuggler's Shiv</i> sometime past. He was a passenger aboard the all-tengu vessel, and close
					personal friends of Captain Eraka Zoventai, a bright red cardinal-like tengu who gave Pezock his saw-toothed
					saber. All of the other survivors were killed by the shiv's cannibals.</p>
				<!-- <p>Quest: Pezock misses his dear friend, Captain Eraka Zoventai, and he wishes he had something more to remember
					her by than his singe saw-toothed saber. Idea! What if he had two saw-toothed sabers?!? If they can board the
					wreckage of the <i>Crow's Tooth</i> and recover the captain's other saber, and return it to poor Pezock, he'd
					be ever so grateful.</p> -->
				<!-- <p>Boon: In his addled state, poor Pezock can only offer everything he has - the survivors may set up camp in
					and around his little home.</p> -->
				<p>Upgraded Boon: Cured of his madness (for the moment), Pezock is able to share some of his combat tactics. He
					grants everyone Exotic Weapon Proficiency (Sawtooth Saber), and anyone dealing sneak attack damage with a
					sawtooth saber may gain the benefit of the Bleeding Attack rogue talent.</p>

				<h3>Sasha Nevah</h3>
				<!-- <strong>Boarded at Ilizmagorti</strong><br><br> -->
				<strong>Rival: Red Mantis</strong><br><br>
				<!-- <strong class="spiritBlack" style="color: #50C878">Emerald Mantis</strong><br><br> -->
				<figure class="multiImage">
					<img src="/serpents/images/npc-sasha-nevah.png" alt="Sasha Nevah">
				</figure>
				<p>Appearance: Sasha has tousled red hair and mischievous green eyes, and is missing the pinky finger of her
					left hand. She bears a tattoo between her shoulder blades
					<!-- — the symbol of the Red Mantis, a “gift” from her mother before Sasha’s personality made it apparent she could never belong-->.
					Slender and athletic, Sasha never stands still or stays quiet for long.
				</p>
				<p>Background: Sasha Nevah is a daughter of the Red Mantis, yet while she shows great promise — she’s a natural
					fighter, takes pride in her grace, and delights in violence— she’ll never make it as an assassin because of
					her insatiable curiosity, her love of animals, and rebellious streak. Had her mother not been a highly
					regarded member of the Red Mantis, Sasha would have doubtless met with a tragic accident years ago. Sasha has
					little interest in joining the Mantis, as she rankles at even the thought of following orders. Impulsive and
					reckless, she’s caused plenty of awkward problems for her mother — and while being sent to Sargava to assist
					with Mantis interests in Eleder is not technically exile, her mother has certainly made it clear that if she
					returns to Ilizmagorti, she’ll never leave it again. Sasha understood what her mother meant (especially after
					she severed one of Sasha’s fingers to drive home the warning), but rather than dwell on the fact that her
					mother threatened her life, she sees this as a great opportunity for adventure.</p>
				<!-- <p>Quest: Sasha finds much of the local wildlife adorable, particularly the poisonous ones. If some can be found
					for her, she promises to look after them, take the best care of them, and keep them under control and out of
					the other's bed's. She would dearly love to have a baby black mamba, dimorphodon, and shiv dragon as a pet.
				</p> -->
				<!-- <p>Boon: Anyone who studies under Sasha gains a permanent +1 bonus on Initiative checks.</p> -->

				<h3>Neiford "The Arrow" Sharrowsmith</h3>
				<strong>G.C.S.</strong><br><br>
				<!-- <strong class="spirit">&reg;Cartographer Walrus&reg;</strong><br><br> -->
				<figure class="multiImage">
					<img src="/serpents/images/npc-neiford-sharrowsmith.jpg" alt="Neiford Sharrowsmith">
				</figure>
				<p>Appearance: While once a moderately-attractive man in his mid thirties, Sharrowsmith suffers from horrific
					swelling manifesting in large and painful lumps of skin and hair on his chest, back, and neck. In constant
					pain and straining his muscles to look in a specified direction (against his will), Sharrowsmith has become
					prone to regular mood swings, alternating between good days where his old enthusiasm for exploration is
					dominant, to days when he seems embittered and withdrawn, silently staring off into the distance.</p>
				<p>Background: An acclaimed scout and explorer, sharrowsmith dropped out of college to join up with a
					wilderness-mapping team with the G.C.S. Proving naturally gifted at woodcraft and highly knowledgeable about a
					wide variety of things (due to his partial college education), he soon began leading expeditions into
					dangerous ruins, often going alone when a mission needed speed, secrecy, or security - especially if it
					required all three.</p>
				<p>Quest: Track down the mushroom man that cursed him and find a way to break his curse.</p>
				<!-- <p>Boon: Once per day, Sharrowsmith can gift an explorer with a single scroll containing any 3rd level or lower
					bard spell for free - though while the scroll is free, if the spell has expensive material components, he will
					need those components to finish the scroll. These scrolls are custom-made for the person requesting it and
					cannot be sold, though the person who requested the scroll gains a +5 circumstance bonus on Use Magic Device
					checks to activate the scroll. Sharrowsmith can only make 5 spell-levels worth of scrolls in a week, and will
					not give you a new scroll if you already have 5 of his scrolls in your possession.</p> -->

				<h3>Aycenia - The Spirit of the Hill</h3>
				<figure class="two-three">
					<img src="/serpents/images/npc-aycenia.png" alt="Aycenia">
				</figure>
				<p>Appearance: The dryad of the single, 60 ft. banyan tree standing on the highest point of <i>Smuggler's
						Shiv</i>, Aycenia has light-bark skin, rain water eyes, and palm-frond hair. Her voice sounds like the
					rustling of the leaves of her banyan tree, and while she speaks eagerly, her language is as someone who rarely
					has a companion for conversation.</p>
				<p>Background: She is a tree. Her life is the life of the tree that has been on this same hill for over a
					century. She's young for a tree, though still older than most of the trees on this island. The activities and
					intents of the cannibals are of no interest to her - she is a tree.</p>
				<!-- <p>Quest: She does not know all things, but she does know that part of her realm is suffering a hideous blight.
					She can sense the foul intrusion of the fungus on the Silent Island to the north , but is relatively powerless
					to do anything about it, for she fears what the fungal blight might do to her even if she were brave enough to
					abandon her tree to handle the situation herself. </p> -->
				<p>Boon: Aycenia not only promises to allow the PCs to rest on her hill as often as they wish, but she also
					pledges to use her magic to aid them in whatever method they desire. She also knows much about this island and
					its inhabitants, and can answer most specific questions, though her alien mind is unlikely to spontaneously
					think of information the survivors might find useful.</p>

				<h3>Ieana</h3>
				<strong>Boarded at Magnimar</strong><br><br>
				<figure class="two-three">
					<img src="/serpents/images/npc-ieana.jpg" alt="Ieana">
				</figure>
				<p>Appearance: Mysterious and scantily clad, Ieana allows scarves to both hide and highlight her features, while
					the charms and bracelets move asynchronously with her movements, giving her an odd combination of graceful and
					awkward motions, like she doesn't quite fit in her slender frame.</p>
				<p>Background: A bookish Varisian scholar who tends to keep to herself, Ieana is traveling to Sargava to explore
					the ancient ruins there. Rumors aboard the ship alternately suggest that she’s the <i>Jenivere</i>’s owner, a
					Chelish agent, or Captain Kovack’s secret lover. Ieana keeps mostly to herself, and grows more intent on her
					studies with each mile the ship travels closer to Eleder.</p>
				<p>Death: Was killed and replaced before she got aboard the <i>Jenivere</i>.</p>

					<img src="/serpents/images/npc-rambar-terillo.png" alt="Rambar Terillo">
				</figure>
				<p>Rail thin and incredibly jumpy, Ship's Cook Terillo is most memorable for his shrill screams at the sight of
					all kinds of bugs. Meticulously clean, he keeps his blond hair cropped short and his beard and thin mustache
					precisely trimmed.</p>
				<p>Background: A taciturn man from Senghor, Ship’s Cook Terillo has served in that capacity aboard several
					ships, though apparently not on account of his culinary skills, which seem to be limited to watery soups.</p>
				<p>Killed by a snake bite aboard the <i>Jenivere</i>.</p>

				</figure>
				<p>Appearance: A youthful but weathered man, First Mate Devers has an easygoing attitude coupled with an
					impeccable sense of honor and duty which he strives to impart to the crew.</p>
				<p>Background: The <i>Jenivere</i>’s first mate is friendly with both passengers and crew, but he sometimes
					seems to chafe under the strong discipline of Captain Kovack.</p>
				<p>Death: Succumbed to his mysterious injuries and eurypterid poison.</p>

				</figure>
				<p>Appearance: Smartly but practically dressed, Captain Kovack has a precisely trimmed bears and mustache, a
					crisp tricorn hat he wears when above deck, and a particularly-piercing gaze.</p>
				<p>Background: A Chelish man whose family has made the Magnimar to Eleder run for generations, Captain Kovack is
					pleasant enough with his passengers, but a strict disciplinarian when dealing with his crew. </p>

				<figure class="two-three">
					<img src="/serpents/images/npc-yarzoth.png" alt="Yarzoth the Serpentfolk Priest">
				</figure>
				<p>Appearance: Her slender frame and awkward grace are no longer incongruous, now that the illusion has been
					dropped. With two legs, clawed hands, and the head of a snake, this sorcerous looks almost as treacherous as
					she behaves.</p>
				<p>Background: Arrogant and unconcerned with the fate of the survivors of the <i>Jenivere</i>, little is known
					about this serpentfolk's past. What has been pieced together is that she killed and took the place of Ieana,
					enthralled the captain, poisoned the crew, and wrecked the ship on Smuggler's Shiv in order to reach an
					ancient temple of Zura on the island. There, she pieced together a map to the lost city of Saventh-Yhi.</p>

				<h3>Umargo</h3>

				<figure class="two-three">
					<img src="/serpents/images/npc-umargo.jpg" alt="Umargo">
				</figure>
				<p>Appearance: Umargo wears a dark cloak, and paints his face in tribal warrior patterns. His armor and weapons
					are clearly new, though they are designed to imitate the appearance of older weapons belonging to venerable
					Mwangi empires.</p>
				<p>Background: At a young age, Umargo was captured by slavers and sold into slavery. Much of his youth was spent
					digging in the salt mines, until he was sold into the slave armies of a Chelish trading company. Stationed at
					Kalabuto, he and his fellow slaves revolted during a Mzali siege. Escaping to Eleder, he joined the movement
					of ex slaves known as the Freeman’s Brotherhood, eventually rising to power and turning the once peaceful
					organization into a group of violent revolutionaries.</p>

				<strong>Rival: Ivory Cross</strong>
				<figure class="two-three">
					<img src="/serpents/images/npc-amersanus-valacosti.jpg" alt="Amersanus Valacosti">
				</figure>
				<p>Appearance: Amersanus Valacosti seems to have boundless energy; he carries himself with the poise and posture
					of nobility, affecting a Chelish accent and speech mannerisms to hide any telltale sign that would indicate
					his true nationality. The only tell of weakness Valacosti may have is his noticeable limp and the stiffness of
					his right leg, which requires Valacosti to walk with the assistance of an ebony cane topped with a black,
					serpentine dragon coiled into a figure eight.</p>
				<p>Background: A shrewd politician working with the Ivory Cross, Valacosti seeks the moonstone of Ashkurhall,
					one of the keys to finding the lost city of Saventh-Yhi. Far too meticulous to to risk an open confrontation
					while within the borders of Sargava, he seeks to further his aims with minimal risk, relying on hired agents
					and mercenaries to carry out his whim.</p>
				<p>Death: Killed by the Golden Guardian of Ashkurhall after being baited by the party.</p>
