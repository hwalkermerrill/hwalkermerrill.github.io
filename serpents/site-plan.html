    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this website is to support a passion project. Specifically, this website is intended to contain
      data about a local tabletop game run by the student - Harrison Merrill. This website will contain several pages,
      each with a specific purpose - general overview of the game format, player character creation instructions,
      details on discoveries made and items found by the players, player profiles, npc profiles, maps of location, a
      journal of activities at each session, and a lengthy rules and reference segment. By containing all of this
      information on an interactive site, it will reduce the overhead on book-keeping, have images to associate with
      major character, items, and locations, and create a community notes/reference for the game table so that everyone
      can more easily remember both what happened already and things their characters would already know. It also
      provides a place for me (the person running the game) to embed notes on things I want to develop, have developed
      that the players have not yet uncovered, and have developed for the players (so that I can remember what already
      exists). Frankly, it takes a lot of work, running a game, and by placing everything on a website, it creates a
      more interactive and easy to read set of notes as compared to a simple word document and excel files.</p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>The audience for this site is myself, a handful of current active players, and a small number of either former
      players or potential players who want to know whats happening at game the table.</p>
    <!-- change this -->

    <h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
    <p>The entire website should have dynamic scaling so that it appears correctly when viewed on a phone, tablet,
      laptop, or tv. Most of the elements are designed so that they hide unnecessary details (making it easier to
      navigate) until the user clicks on that portion, at which time more details are revealed. This enables the website
      to stay attractive and slim while also being information dense. The website also includes many images which can be
      clicked to view in a modal image viewer. The website also uses .js to import data from lengthy libraries and
      automatically generate content for the page, specifically regarding session notes, magic items, and characters
      (thus reducing manual duplication of effort). The website also uses a mouseover zoom-cursor on the main map,
      allowing players to point at specific locations on the map.</p>

    <h2>Wireframes</h2>
    <p>
      Create two wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them
      here
    </p>

    <h3>Home</h3>
    <p>
      I wasn't sure if you wanted me to create the wireframes using specific software, but I was hoping I could use
      this, since it was free. However, it does not export images without paying for a license, so I am including the
      URL link to the cloud version of the wireframe.
