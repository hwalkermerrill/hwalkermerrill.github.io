    <h1>Where Are We?!?</h1>
    <h3>
      <i>&nbsp;"The jungle knows no god but its own hunger. Mighty beasts enter, and not even bones return. Ancient
        rivers pour endlessly in, and are drunk down, every drop. Even spirits, given up beneath the canopy, become
        snared and tangled - dragged down amid roots and vines. But the jungle's hunger is not a dead thing like mine
        and yours. The jungle keeps what it eats, makes it part of itself, and grows rich and tall and ever more deadly.
        And amid its fat miles and heavy limbs what once were the ghosts of things that walk and crawl open new eyes
        amid the brush, and know a new hunger. A hunger like the jungle's."</i>

        <h2>Where We Are Now: The Korir River</h2>
        <a href="/serpents/images/hero-great-river.jpg"><img src="/serpents/images/hero-great-river.jpg"
            alt="The Korir River"></a>
        <p>Known to the locals simply as "The River," this river flows through the entirety of the Mwangi Expanse,
          flowing down from the shattered range, through the jungles and hills, past countless ruined civilizations, and
          emptying in to the ocean to the west through large delta's. The word "Korir" is a portmanteau of the polyglot
          words for serpent, "Koruvil," and the common word for river, suggesting a river as winding as it is endless.
          The large number of waterfalls and rapids coupled with the jungle terrain make both navigation and portaging
          difficult, and while this does reduce the number of crocodiles, hippopotamuses, and enchanted dolphins
          frequently encountered, it does have the added threat of large snakes dropping on passing prey from branches
          hanging over the river.</p>
        <p>Few explorers dare navigate the waters all the way to the shattered range, and none have successfully managed
          to bridge the gap and sail from one end of the continent to the other. While the shattered range is the most
          obvious perilous obstacle, most explorers get lost just traveling through the screaming jungle, with its heavy
          daily rains, low obscuring fog, endless chattering monkeys, and heavy dreams which pull people into fevered
          nightmares and sleeping sickness. Fatigue takes many, and eventually, sleep takes all. It is said that all
          people dream of the jungle and its treasures...</p>

        <h2>Destination: Ruins of Tazion</h2>
        <a href="/serpents/images/map-ruins-tazion.jpg"><img src="/serpents/images/map-ruins-tazion.jpg"
            alt="Ruins of Tazion"></a>
        <p> The ruins of Tazion stand as a remnant of a forgotten age, an outpost of ancient Azlant lost in the southern
          Mwangi Jungle. Little remains within its walls, with most of the settlement having crumbled or been buried
          centuries before. The majority of Tazion’s structures remain unidentifiable. Centuries of weathering and
          erosion have transformed the once-splendid architecture into little more than scattered stones, curious
          topography, and fetid tar pits. Few could have ever suspected that the ruins possess the key to finding the
          lost city of Saventh-Yhi, and its secrets are ripe for the taking.</p>
        <p>Rumor says that a tribe of ape-men, known as charau-ka, now inhabit the ruins, though they wouldn't share its
          secrets in the unlikely event they discovered any. From the ruins, they have reportedly established a temple
          in the shape of a serpent's skull; this temple is now the ape-men’s main encampment, where they gather to
          share information and deposit relics they have found in the ruins as offerings to their new snake-god.</p>
        <p>The Charau-Ka are dangerous, xenophobic abominations, whose very name translates from polyglot to
          "Beware-Them," though it is unclear if they are named after the phrase, or if the phrase exist because of the
          abominations. As mysterious as they are dangerous, and as fetid as they are strong, it is unwise to try to
          communicate with them, as while semi-intelligent, they are unlikely to speak unless they can use speaking to
          bait their victims into a trap. Those who find themselves encircled by Charau-Ka frequently take their own
          lives to prevent capture, out of fear of being brutalized and transformed into another of their kind.</p>

      <h2>Where We Have Been:</h2>
      <section class="clearfix">
        <h3>Fort Bandu</h3>
        <a href="/serpents/images/npc-praetor-sylien-wide.jpg"><img src="/serpents/images/npc-praetor-sylien-wide.jpg"
            alt="Praetor Sylien"></a>
        <p>Created to protect miners in the Bandu Hills from hostile Mwangi, Fort Bandu has suffered in the last hundred
          years — much to the consternation of its half elf commander, Praetor Sylien. Having commanded the fort for
          decades, the Praetor is the grandson of an old elven explorer. Though the aging Sylien rarely ventures outside
          anymore, he is a skilled commander of his 150-soldier legion, and it is largely thanks to him that miners and
          explorers are able to operate in the area at all. Fort Bandu nevertheless still has tremendous difficulties
          with local tribes, particularly the Bandu, who take every opportunity to attack the work crews Sylien has sent
          to build a bridge over the River of Tears.</p>
        <p>The fort is a small frontier settlement surrounded by high stone walls located on the northern edge of
          Sargava. Within the fort’s walls, dozens of mining companies maintain outposts out of pavilion tents, hiring
          laborers and purchasing necessary supplies brought in by merchants from the north, south, and west. The fort's
          garrison struggle to maintain a balance of defense of the frontier and protection for the miners and traders
          within its walls.</p>
        <p>The fort is also a training ground and staging point for Sargava's embattled militia. Because watches at Fort
          Bandu are relatively peaceful, militia personnel can become accustomed to their responsibilities before moving
          on to assignments requiring more vigilance. While the training of the militia excels under the old Praetor's
          gaze, he has been openly displeased with the quality of the officer pool sent to him, and he has been unable
          to train someone he deems would be a suitable successor. Until that day, he does what he deems best for the
          fort and the people in his jurisdiction, frequently asking adventurers to fill the gap by assisting with
          training or escorting new patrols in exchange for granting them permission to venture deep into the Laughing
          Jungle.</p>

        <h3>Kalabuto</h3>
        <a href="/serpents/images/hero-kalabuto.jpg"><img src="/serpents/images/hero-kalabuto.jpg" alt="Kalabuto"></a>
        <p>From a distance, Kalabuto seems to be nothing more than a low hill surrounded by fields of pineapples, with a
          few scattered buildings under a pall of smoke. This is because the city ruins are almost entirely covered with
          centuries of jungle growth. Closer up, visitors quickly notice the thousands of native Mwangi coming and going
          from the city in the hustle and bustle of commerce and daily life. For many, it’s not until they approach
          quite close to the city gates that they realize the hill is actually a collection of crumbling stone buildings
          covered in tangled vines and other greenery.</p>
        <p>As it stands, the city appears to be overgrown by the jungle, with a large collection of shanties and
          warehouses along the riverbank. Kalabuto is a center of trade with the Mwangi interior, serving as a trade hub
          between foreign colonials, foreigners, and indigenous tribespeople. Over the years, overland caravans have
          declined in favor of more efficient river barges. To accommodate the increase in vessels, the city erected a
          snaking boardwalk connected to an elaborate tangle of docks. Warehouses make up the bulk of the structures
          along the water’s edge. Further inland, the ruins of the original ancient city begin, climbing up the hill to
          the more lavish private colonial residences.</p>
        <p>While native Kalabuta-Vidric inhabit the majority of the city’s ruins, a small minority of Sargavan colonials
          rule the city and have claimed the highest buildings with the best views for themselves. Racial tension is
          thus rife in Kalabuto. But the city also serves as Sargava’s first line of defense against the city-state of
          Mzali. In this role Kalabuto has suffered greatly, and has been sacked by the Mzali forces on several
          occasions. </p>
        <p>Not just the most populous city in Sargava, Kalabuto sits on the edge of the expansive jungle; the last
          bastion of civilization before the wilderness. In contrast to Eleder, explorers and adventurers find that
          Kalabuto awaits them with open arms. . Those who do not find work as soldiers in the Kalabuto militia usually
          find plenty of opportunities with expeditions setting out to explore the Bandu Hills, Mzali, and the Screaming
          Jungle; the colonials look forward to sending new adventurers on the dangerous missions the local Mwangi
          refuse to undertake, while the natives readily hire themselves out to adventurers, who often treat and pay
          them better than the colonials.</p>

        <h3>Eleder</h3>
        <a href="/serpents/images/hero-eleder.jpg"><img src="/serpents/images/hero-eleder.jpg" alt="Eleder"></a>
        <p>Appearance: Eleder is dominated by extensive stone docks, where ships from most nations on the Arcadian Ocean
          lie moored. The city is an unusual blend of architecture, as the gothic stonework of the colonists’ native
          Cheliax has adapted to the native building styles in favor of less stuffy, open designs that better combat the
          heat. Although Eleder itself is surrounded by a sturdy stone wall, the individual homes of many colonials also
          feature low stone walls and iron gates—a decorative concession to their roots that does nothing to make their
          homes less comfortable. These buildings are joined by more practical wood and canvas structures, and outside
          the city walls, countless mud-daub huts — the homes of the native workers — stretch far out into the banana,
          cocoa, and pineapple plantations.</p>
        <p>History: The original founders of Sargava selected a small, natural harbor as the site of their future
          colony, gradually expanding from a stockaded encampment to a walled city with a fully equipped shipyard. It
          was named Eleder after the daughter of one of the original colonists, whose gentle diplomacy and efforts to
          learn Polyglot enabled the colonists to live in cooperation with the locals. Though the city today is named
          for Eleder’s efforts, the first several decades were fraught with violent misunderstandings between Chelaxians
          and natives. Large numbers of Chelish troops were brought in to help bring the native tribes under control,
          and they gradually convinced the tribes to assist the colonists in bringing “order” and industry to their
          “savage” land. When Sargava broke from Cheliax with the help of the Shackles, the citizens of Eleder opened up
          their repair yards as docks to ships of any nation, provided they paid a hefty fee for the privilege. Eleder
          is now considered one of the finest shipyards in Garund, and certainly the finest on the western coast. With
          the appointment of Utilinus to the position of Grand Custodian, Eleder has even made a few strides toward
          attracting other foreign businesses — mainly merchants from Nidal, Varisia, and Rahadoum. But though he has
          gained popularity with the colonials, the Grand Custodian is not well liked by the Hurricane King, who heavily
          taxes the merchant fleets his pirates guide past the Eye of Abendego.</p>
        <p>Society: Eleder is a city of contradictions. The colonials live in relative luxury, while the native workers
          dwell in poverty outside the city walls. While countless scruffy sailors and explorers parade through Eleder
          every year en route to adventures in the interior — or simply on their way to enjoy the brothels and clubs
          Eleder maintains near the docks to keep pirates out of the city proper — the colonials maintain high personal
          standards of decorum and propriety. Although Grand Custodian Utilinus is Sargava’s authority, the elderly Lady
          Madrona Daugustana is the city’s unofficial leader. As the oldest living colonial in all of Sargava, Lady
          Madrona bears the responsibility of upholding the ideals and customs of her forebearers, and any major
          undertaking must meet her approval.While the majority of colonials consider the native Mwangi to be a “lesser
          people” than themselves, they rely on them not only as a labor pool but as a standing militia of poorly paid
          volunteers. Eleder’s Praetor, Commander Ezio Egorius, regularly drills the Sargavan Guard, which consists of
          mixed units, though all Mwangi natives are enlisted regulars while the colonials are all officers, much to the
          ire of many Mwangi veterans.</p>
        <p>Adventurers: Though Sargava relies on the influx of foreign money to pay its debts to the Shackles pirates,
          the Eleder colonials would much rather the seemingly constant stream of adventurers and explorers sail up the
          Korir River to their destinations incountry, bypassing Eleder completely. In the words of Lady Madrona
          Daugustana, “Adventurers merely pass through Eleder; we must live here when they are long gone.”The major
          problem most colonials have with adventurers is that the colonials are barely keeping the Mwangi populace
          under control as it as, and in their view, the last thing they need is thrill-seekers or would-be “liberators”
          stirring up the natives, either by picking fights with tribal warriors or speaking ill of the colonials to the
          workers.Adding to the problem, adventurers rarely bother to learn the local customs, let alone observe the
          agreements between the tribes and the colonials, and a single incident can sour an entire tribe against all
          foreigners.Finally, the people of Eleder are obsessed with dignity and decorum — going even beyond many
          northern countries in their attempts to prove that they’ve remained “civilized” — and consider the carousing
          of bored adventurers the height of impropriety. It is bad enough for dwarves to stagger through the streets
          singing after dark, but having one’s daughter indecently solicited by an Ulfen barbarian quickly alienates
          even the most open-minded Sargavan colonist.</p>

            src="/serpents/images/hero-souls-for-smugglers-shiv.jpg" alt="Souls for Smuggler's Shiv"></a>
        <p><i>&nbsp;"They say the dead walk on Smuggler's Shiv, and that those who have yet to die dine on the flesh of
            their kin. They say that the very plants and animals of the island thirst for blood. And they say that those
            who sail too close to the island's cutting edge are already doomed, even before their ships are impaled and
            slip beneath the shark-hungry waves. The island itself is a grave to all manner of folk - pirate and
            soldier, merchant and smuggler alike. By day, one who approaches too closely can hear their screams from the
            green that crowns the isle, and by night one can watch the witchlights dance on its shore, said to be
            glowing cannibal ghosts eager to lure new meals to their shore.</i></p>
        <p><i>&nbsp;"They say all this and more about Smuggler's Shiv. I can think of no better place to hide my
            treaure."</i> - Final recorded words of Captain Lortch Quellig</p>
        <p>Smuggler’s Shiv is a notorious island north of Eleder. It’s not shown on most maps, but is rightfully feared
          by those who ply the waters of Desperation Bay. The island is named not only for the knife-like shape of its
          coastline, but for its uncanny habit of wrecking ships that draw too near—mostly smugglers eager to avoid
          detection by Sargava’s navy. </p>
        <p>It’s commonly believed that the shores of Smuggler’s Shiv are haunted by the ghosts and ghouls of the sailors
          who have died on the jagged rocks and reefs surrounding the island. These rumors are supported by reports of
          several failed attempts to establish long-lasting colonies on the remote island. </p>
        <p>When Sargava was first settled, Chelish engineers erected a lighthouse on the Shiv’s southwest shore. The
          light was intended to warn approaching ships of the dangerous waters and, eventually, was to have been the
          first building in a small colony. The light and all plans for colonization were abandoned just before
          completion amid rumors of curses, haunts, and cannibalism. </p>
        <p>Rumors hold that a group of shipwrecked Chelish soldiers, survivors of an attempted Thrune invasion of
          Sargava some 70 years ago, were stranded on the island. The rumors claim that they degenerated into a
          cannibalistic society, and that their descendants scour the isle’s shores for shipwreck victims to add to
          their meals. </p>

        <h3>Sargava at a Glance</h3>
        <a href="/serpents/images/map-sargava.jpg"><img src="/serpents/images/map-sargava.jpg"
            alt="Sargave Territory Map"></a>
        <p>Beset by devil-binding pilgrims and inescapable debts to pirate lords, as well as generations of resentment
          from the nation’s subjugated indigenous peoples, the colony of Sargava remains a bastion of northern culture
          and civilization in the heart of the southern wilds. Once part of a vast and mighty empire long since fallen
          to dust, as evidenced by the crumbling ruins still lurking beneath the veneer of lush farmland and verdant
          jungle, Sargava’s rich landscape is home to fierce Mwangi natives and even fiercer predators of the deep
          jungle, as well as a dwindling population of northern colonials who seek to uphold their ideals of culture and
          breeding at all cost, straining against the tides of resentment that may soon sweep them into the sea and
          return the land to its original owners.</p>
        <p>Founded over 500 years ago by Prince Haliad I as part of Cheliax’s expansionist Everwar, Sargava stood as the
          jewel of the empire for centuries. But when Aroden died, the empire was thrown into chaos, and Sargava’s ruler
          backed the wrong house in the Chelish Civil War. House Thrune took control of Cheliax and sent a flotilla of
          warships to retake the colony that had supported their enemy in the bloody conflict. Grand Custodian Grallus
          anticipated the onslaught, however, and made a fateful alliance with the Free Captains of the Shackles.
          Swooping out of Desperation Bay to pounce on the unsuspecting Chelish Navy, the pirates’ superior fleet
          swiftly ended the threat to their southern neighbor, and extracted a mighty price from Sargava for their
          efforts. To this day, vast portions of Sargava’s wealth flow into the Free Captains’ coffers for past
          assistance and assurance of continued naval protection.</p>
        <p>Financially weakened by the Free Captains’ high demands and cut off from many of their former trade partners
          to the north, Sargava faces an even larger threat from within. The native Mwangi people, inspired by the
          teachings of a mysterious, undead child-god in the nearby city-state of Mzali, move ever closer to open
          rebellion to free themselves from colonial rule. While Cheliax no longer has an official stake in Sargava’s
          government, the colonial Sargavan minority maintains control of the vastly larger native population. But the
          natives know that they have the resources of the entire Mwangi Expanse at their backs, and that Grand
          Custodian Utilinus’s government is in a poor position to quell a rebellion.</p>
