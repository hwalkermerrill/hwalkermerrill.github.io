		<h1>Where Are We?!?</h1>
		<blockquote><strong>
				&nbsp;"The jungle knows no god but its own hunger. Mighty beasts enter, and not even bones return. Ancient
				rivers pour endlessly in, and are drunk down, every drop. Even spirits, given up beneath the canopy, become
				snared and tangled - dragged down amid roots and vines. But the jungle's hunger is not a dead thing like mine
				and yours. The jungle keeps what it eats, makes it part of itself, and grows rich and tall and ever more deadly.
				And amid its fat miles and heavy limbs what once were the ghosts of things that walk and crawl open new eyes
				amid the brush, and know a new hunger. A hunger like the jungle's."

				<h2>Where We Are Now: The Korir River</h2>
				<picture>
					<source srcset="/serpents/images/sketch-great-river.webp" type="image/webp">
					<img class="pointer" src="/serpents/images/unknown.png" alt="The Korir River" loading="lazy">
				</picture>
				<p>Known to the locals simply as "The River," this river flows through the entirety of the Mwangi Expanse,
					flowing down from the shattered range, through the jungles and hills, past countless ruined civilizations, and
					emptying in to the ocean to the west through large delta's. The word "Korir" is a portmanteau of the polyglot
					words for Serpent's Tears, suggesting a river that is winding, sorrowful, and endless.
					The large number of waterfalls and rapids coupled with the jungle terrain make both navigation and portaging
					difficult, and while this does reduce the number of crocodiles, hippopotamuses, and enchanted dolphins
					frequently encountered, it does have the added threat of large snakes dropping on passing prey from branches
					hanging over the river.</p>
				<p>Few explorers dare navigate the waters all the way to the shattered range, and none have successfully managed
					to bridge the gap and sail from one end of the continent to the other. While the shattered range is the most
					obvious perilous obstacle, most explorers get lost just traveling through the screaming jungle, with its heavy
					daily rains, low obscuring fog, endless chattering monkeys, and heavy dreams which pull people into fevered
					nightmares and sleeping sickness. Fatigue takes many, and eventually, sleep takes all. It is said that all
					people dream of the jungle and its treasures...</p>

				<h2>Destination: Ruins of Tazion</h2>
				<picture>
					<source srcset="/serpents/images/hero-tazion.webp" type="image/webp">
					<img class="pointer" src="/serpents/images/unknown.png" alt="Ruins of Tazion" loading="lazy">
				</picture>
				<p> The ruins of Tazion stand as a remnant of a forgotten age, an outpost of ancient Azlant lost in the southern
					Mwangi Jungle. Little remains within its walls, with most of the settlement having crumbled or been buried
					centuries before. The majority of Tazion’s structures remain unidentifiable. Centuries of weathering and
					erosion have transformed the once-splendid architecture into little more than scattered stones, curious
					topography, and fetid tar pits. Few could have ever suspected that the ruins possess the key to finding the
					lost city of Saventh-Yhi, and its secrets are ripe for the taking.</p>
				<p>Rumor says that a tribe of ape-men, known as charau-ka, now inhabit the ruins, though they wouldn't share its
					secrets in the unlikely event they discovered any. From the ruins, they have reportedly established a temple
					in the shape of a serpent's skull; this temple is now the ape-men’s main encampment, where they gather to
					share information and deposit relics they have found in the ruins as offerings to their new snake-god.</p>
				<p>The Charau-Ka are dangerous, xenophobic abominations, whose very name translates from polyglot to
					"Beware-Them," though it is unclear if they are named after the phrase, or if the phrase exist because of the
					abominations. As mysterious as they are dangerous, and as fetid as they are strong, it is unwise to try to
					communicate with them, as while semi-intelligent, they are unlikely to speak unless they can use speaking to
					bait their victims into a trap. Those who find themselves encircled by Charau-Ka frequently take their own
					lives to prevent capture, out of fear of being brutalized and transformed into another of their kind.</p>

			<h2>Where We Have Been:</h2>
			<section class="clearfix">
				<h3>Fort Bandu</h3>
				<picture>
					<source srcset="/serpents/images/npc-praetor-sylien.webp" type="image/webp">
					<img class="tooTall pointer" src="/serpents/images/unknown.png" alt="Praetor Sylien, Fort Bandu Commander"
						loading="lazy">
				</picture>
				<p>Created to protect miners in the Bandu Hills from hostile Mwangi, Fort Bandu has suffered in the last hundred
					years — much to the consternation of its half elf commander, Praetor Sylien. Having commanded the fort for
					decades, the Praetor is the grandson of an old elven explorer. Though the aging Sylien rarely ventures outside
					anymore, he is a skilled commander of his 150-soldier legion, and it is largely thanks to him that miners and
					explorers are able to operate in the area at all. Fort Bandu nevertheless still has tremendous difficulties
					with local tribes, particularly the Bandu, who take every opportunity to attack the work crews Sylien has sent
					to build a bridge over the River of Tears.</p>
				<p>The fort is a small frontier settlement surrounded by high stone walls located on the northern edge of
					Sargava. Within the fort’s walls, dozens of mining companies maintain outposts out of pavilion tents, hiring
					laborers and purchasing necessary supplies brought in by merchants from the north, south, and west. The fort's
					garrison struggle to maintain a balance of defense of the frontier and protection for the miners and traders
					within its walls.</p>
				<p>The fort is also a training ground and staging point for Sargava's embattled militia. Because watches at Fort
					Bandu are relatively peaceful, militia personnel can become accustomed to their responsibilities before moving
					on to assignments requiring more vigilance. While the training of the militia excels under the old Praetor's
					gaze, he has been openly displeased with the quality of the officer pool sent to him, and he has been unable
					to train someone he deems would be a suitable successor. Until that day, he does what he deems best for the
					fort and the people in his jurisdiction, frequently asking adventurers to fill the gap by assisting with
					training or escorting new patrols in exchange for granting them permission to venture deep into the Laughing
					Jungle.</p>

				<h3>Kalabuto</h3>
				<picture>
					<source srcset="/serpents/images/hero-kalabuto.webp" type="image/webp">
					<img class="pointer" src="/serpents/images/unknown.png" alt="Kalabuto" loading="lazy">
				</picture>
				<p>From a distance, Kalabuto seems to be nothing more than a low hill surrounded by fields of pineapples, with a
					few scattered buildings under a pall of smoke. This is because the city ruins are almost entirely covered with
					centuries of jungle growth. Closer up, visitors quickly notice the thousands of native Mwangi coming and going
					from the city in the hustle and bustle of commerce and daily life. For many, it’s not until they approach
					quite close to the city gates that they realize the hill is actually a collection of crumbling stone buildings
					covered in tangled vines and other greenery.</p>
				<p>As it stands, the city appears to be overgrown by the jungle, with a large collection of shanties and
					warehouses along the riverbank. Kalabuto is a center of trade with the Mwangi interior, serving as a trade hub
					between foreign colonials, foreigners, and indigenous tribespeople. Over the years, overland caravans have
					declined in favor of more efficient river barges. To accommodate the increase in vessels, the city erected a
					snaking boardwalk connected to an elaborate tangle of docks. Warehouses make up the bulk of the structures
					along the water’s edge. Further inland, the ruins of the original ancient city begin, climbing up the hill to
					the more lavish private colonial residences.</p>
				<p>While native Kalabuta-Vidric inhabit the majority of the city’s ruins, a small minority of Sargavan colonials
					rule the city and have claimed the highest buildings with the best views for themselves. Racial tension is
					thus rife in Kalabuto. But the city also serves as Sargava’s first line of defense against the city-state of
					Mzali. In this role Kalabuto has suffered greatly, and has been sacked by the Mzali forces on several
					occasions. </p>
				<p>Not just the most populous city in Sargava, Kalabuto sits on the edge of the expansive jungle; the last
					bastion of civilization before the wilderness. In contrast to Eleder, explorers and adventurers find that
					Kalabuto awaits them with open arms. . Those who do not find work as soldiers in the Kalabuto militia usually
					find plenty of opportunities with expeditions setting out to explore the Bandu Hills, Mzali, and the Screaming
					Jungle; the colonials look forward to sending new adventurers on the dangerous missions the local Mwangi
					refuse to undertake, while the natives readily hire themselves out to adventurers, who often treat and pay
					them better than the colonials.</p>

				<h3>Eleder</h3>
				<picture>
					<source srcset="/serpents/images/hero-eleder.webp" type="image/webp">
					<img class="pointer" src="/serpents/images/unknown.png" alt="Eleder" loading="lazy">
				</picture>
				<p>Appearance: Eleder is dominated by extensive stone docks, where ships from most nations on the Arcadian Ocean
					lie moored. The city is an unusual blend of architecture, as the gothic stonework of the colonists’ native
					Cheliax has adapted to the native building styles in favor of less stuffy, open designs that better combat the
					heat. Although Eleder itself is surrounded by a sturdy stone wall, the individual homes of many colonials also
					feature low stone walls and iron gates—a decorative concession to their roots that does nothing to make their
					homes less comfortable. These buildings are joined by more practical wood and canvas structures, and outside
					the city walls, countless mud-daub huts — the homes of the native workers — stretch far out into the banana,
					cocoa, and pineapple plantations.</p>
				<p>History: The original founders of Sargava selected a small, natural harbor as the site of their future
					colony, gradually expanding from a stockaded encampment to a walled city with a fully equipped shipyard. It
					was named Eleder after the daughter of one of the original colonists, whose gentle diplomacy and efforts to
					learn Polyglot enabled the colonists to live in cooperation with the locals. Though the city today is named
					for Eleder’s efforts, the first several decades were fraught with violent misunderstandings between Chelaxians
					and natives. Large numbers of Chelish troops were brought in to help bring the native tribes under control,
					and they gradually convinced the tribes to assist the colonists in bringing “order” and industry to their
					“savage” land. When Sargava broke from Cheliax with the help of the Shackles, the citizens of Eleder opened up
					their repair yards as docks to ships of any nation, provided they paid a hefty fee for the privilege. Eleder
					is now considered one of the finest shipyards in Garund, and certainly the finest on the western coast. With
					the appointment of Utilinus to the position of Grand Custodian, Eleder has even made a few strides toward
					attracting other foreign businesses — mainly merchants from Nidal, Varisia, and Rahadoum. But though he has
					gained popularity with the colonials, the Grand Custodian is not well liked by the Hurricane King, who heavily
					taxes the merchant fleets his pirates guide past the Eye of Abendego.</p>
				<p>Society: Eleder is a city of contradictions. The colonials live in relative luxury, while the native workers
					dwell in poverty outside the city walls. While countless scruffy sailors and explorers parade through Eleder
					every year en route to adventures in the interior — or simply on their way to enjoy the brothels and clubs
					Eleder maintains near the docks to keep pirates out of the city proper — the colonials maintain high personal
					standards of decorum and propriety. Although Grand Custodian Utilinus is Sargava’s authority, the elderly Lady
					Madrona Daugustana is the city’s unofficial leader. As the oldest living colonial in all of Sargava, Lady
					Madrona bears the responsibility of upholding the ideals and customs of her forebearers, and any major
					undertaking must meet her approval.While the majority of colonials consider the native Mwangi to be a “lesser
					people” than themselves, they rely on them not only as a labor pool but as a standing militia of poorly paid
					volunteers. Eleder’s Praetor, Commander Ezio Egorius, regularly drills the Sargavan Guard, which consists of
					mixed units, though all Mwangi natives are enlisted regulars while the colonials are all officers, much to the
					ire of many Mwangi veterans.</p>
				<p>Adventurers: Though Sargava relies on the influx of foreign money to pay its debts to the Shackles pirates,
					the Eleder colonials would much rather the seemingly constant stream of adventurers and explorers sail up the
					Korir River to their destinations in-country, bypassing Eleder completely. In the words of Lady Madrona
					Daugustana, “Adventurers merely pass through Eleder; we must live here when they are long gone.”The major
					problem most colonials have with adventurers is that the colonials are barely keeping the Mwangi populace
					under control as it as, and in their view, the last thing they need is thrill-seekers or would-be “liberators”
					stirring up the natives, either by picking fights with tribal warriors or speaking ill of the colonials to the
					workers.Adding to the problem, adventurers rarely bother to learn the local customs, let alone observe the
					agreements between the tribes and the colonials, and a single incident can sour an entire tribe against all
					foreigners.Finally, the people of Eleder are obsessed with dignity and decorum — going even beyond many
					northern countries in their attempts to prove that they’ve remained “civilized” — and consider the carousing
					of bored adventurers the height of impropriety. It is bad enough for dwarves to stagger through the streets
					singing after dark, but having one’s daughter indecently solicited by an Ulfen barbarian quickly alienates
					even the most open-minded Sargavan colonist.</p>

				<h3>Smuggler’s Shiv</h3>
				<picture>
					<source srcset="/serpents/images/hero-souls-for-smugglers-shiv.webp" type="image/webp">
					<img class="pointer" src="/serpents/images/unknown.png" alt="Beached on Smuggler's Shiv" loading="lazy">
				</picture>
				<p><i>&nbsp;"They say the dead walk on Smuggler's Shiv, and that those who have yet to die dine on the flesh of
						their kin. They say that the very plants and animals of the island thirst for blood. And they say that those
						who sail too close to the island's cutting edge are already doomed, even before their ships are impaled and
						slip beneath the shark-hungry waves. The island itself is a grave to all manner of folk - pirate and
						soldier, merchant and smuggler alike. By day, one who approaches too closely can hear their screams from the
						green that crowns the isle, and by night one can watch the witchlights dance on its shore, said to be
						glowing cannibal ghosts eager to lure new meals to their shore.</i></p>
				<p><i>&nbsp;"They say all this and more about Smuggler's Shiv. I can think of no better place to hide my
						treasure."</i> - Final recorded words of Captain Lortch Quellig</p>
				<p>Smuggler’s Shiv is a notorious island north of Eleder. It’s not shown on most maps, but is rightfully feared
					by those who ply the waters of Desperation Bay. The island is named not only for the knife-like shape of its
					coastline, but for its uncanny habit of wrecking ships that draw too near—mostly smugglers eager to avoid
					detection by Sargava’s navy. </p>
				<p>It’s commonly believed that the shores of Smuggler’s Shiv are haunted by the ghosts and ghouls of the sailors
					who have died on the jagged rocks and reefs surrounding the island. These rumors are supported by reports of
					several failed attempts to establish long-lasting colonies on the remote island. </p>
				<p>When Sargava was first settled, Chelish engineers erected a lighthouse on the Shiv’s southwest shore. The
					light was intended to warn approaching ships of the dangerous waters and, eventually, was to have been the
					first building in a small colony. The light and all plans for colonization were abandoned just before
					completion amid rumors of curses, haunts, and cannibalism. </p>
				<p>Rumors hold that a group of shipwrecked Chelish soldiers, survivors of an attempted Thrune invasion of
					Sargava some 70 years ago, were stranded on the island. The rumors claim that they degenerated into a
					cannibalistic society, and that their descendants scour the isle’s shores for shipwreck victims to add to
					their meals. </p>

				<h3>Sargava at a Glance</h3>
				<picture>
					<source srcset="/serpents/images/map-sargava.webp" type="image/webp">
					<img class="pointer" src="/serpents/images/unknown.png" alt="Sargavan Territorial Map" loading="lazy">
				</picture>
				<p>Beset by devil-binding pilgrims and inescapable debts to pirate lords, as well as generations of resentment
					from the nation’s subjugated indigenous peoples, the colony of Sargava remains a bastion of northern culture
					and civilization in the heart of the southern wilds. Once part of a vast and mighty empire long since fallen
					to dust, as evidenced by the crumbling ruins still lurking beneath the veneer of lush farmland and verdant
					jungle, Sargava’s rich landscape is home to fierce Mwangi natives and even fiercer predators of the deep
					jungle, as well as a dwindling population of northern colonials who seek to uphold their ideals of culture and
					breeding at all cost, straining against the tides of resentment that may soon sweep them into the sea and
					return the land to its original owners.</p>
				<p>Founded over 500 years ago by Prince Haliad I as part of Cheliax’s expansionist Everwar, Sargava stood as the
					jewel of the empire for centuries. But when Aroden died, the empire was thrown into chaos, and Sargava’s ruler
					backed the wrong house in the Chelish Civil War. House Thrune took control of Cheliax and sent a flotilla of
					warships to retake the colony that had supported their enemy in the bloody conflict. Grand Custodian Grallus
					anticipated the onslaught, however, and made a fateful alliance with the Free Captains of the Shackles.
					Swooping out of Desperation Bay to pounce on the unsuspecting Chelish Navy, the pirates’ superior fleet
					swiftly ended the threat to their southern neighbor, and extracted a mighty price from Sargava for their
					efforts. To this day, vast portions of Sargava’s wealth flow into the Free Captains’ coffers for past
					assistance and assurance of continued naval protection.</p>
				<p>Financially weakened by the Free Captains’ high demands and cut off from many of their former trade partners
					to the north, Sargava faces an even larger threat from within. The native Mwangi people, inspired by the
					teachings of a mysterious, undead child-god in the nearby city-state of Mzali, move ever closer to open
					rebellion to free themselves from colonial rule. While Cheliax no longer has an official stake in Sargava’s
					government, the colonial Sargavan minority maintains control of the vastly larger native population. But the
					natives know that they have the resources of the entire Mwangi Expanse at their backs, and that Grand
					Custodian Utilinus’s government is in a poor position to quell a rebellion.</p>
