				<h2>How this works</h2>
				<blockquote><strong>
						&nbsp;“The jungles don’t recognize time. To them, every year is the same year: one of birth, and of death.
						The plants and beasts care little for the works of man, but those cities are there — oh yes, they’re
						there. Toppled spires of stone and stepped pyramids heavy with vines, their golden altars now roosts for
						chattering macaws. Inside, magnificent chambers stand empty, and those temples that aren’t abandoned are
						the worst yet — for the things that can survive a thousand years of silence are things best left
						undisturbed. The great cities, like their mysterious builders, have been forgotten. In time, they will
						be reclaimed completely by the jungle. As will we all, one day.”

				<h2>Campaign Details</h2>
				<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
					<li style="list-style-type: none;"><b>Click to Show Campaign and Character Details:</b></li>
					<li style="list-style-type: none; display: none;"><b>Click to Hide Campaign and Character Details:</b></li>
					<li style="display: none;"><b>Citizenship:</b> While Sargava and the Mwangi Expanse are primarily home to
						Chelish Colonials and Mwangi natives, adventurers of all nations have reason to journey to the region, be
						they natives to the land returning home from travels abroad or foreigners venturing into uncharted territory
						for the first time. However, most adventurers in the region at this time would be expected to be colonial
						Sargavan or Mwangi natives, hail from either Cheliax, Mediogalti, Varisia, or the Shackles, or else at least
						be from the inner sea region.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><b>Currency:</b> As a former colonial territory of Cheliax, settlements in Sargava
						predominantly use Chelish currency - copper oars, silver ferries, gold helms, and platinum cabins, though
						they refer to all coins by these names and use them relatively interchangeably regardless of mint origin.
						Despite their usage in Cheliax proper, Sargava eschews the use of silver tithes, rejecting their infernal
						origins. The native Mwangi tribes have largely adopted the usage of Sargavan currency over the last 600
						years of colonial occupation, though they do cling to exchanging several types of trade goods in lieu of
						currency, particularly dried cocoa beans, when exchanging with fellow Mwangi peoples.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><b>Languages:</b> Sargava uses the Taldan Common tongue as its official language,
						and all official business in Eleder is conducted in Common, though the local Polyglot is spoken by far more
						people, especially outside of the cities, while Dwarven, Elven, Gnome are common among those populations.
						Other useful languages for this campaign include: Abyssal, Aklo, Ancient Azlanti, Aquan, Boggard, Draconic,
						Giant, Infernal, Kech, Orvian, Undercommon, Sylvan, Terran, and Vegepygmy. A few secret languages (such as
						druidic) and magical communication - particularly <i>speak with animals</i> - will both feature prominently,
						but cannot be achieved by all characters. The regional dialects of Calda, Ekujae, Kibwani, Lirgeni, Mzuno,
						Ocotan, and Xamba, as well as both Kelish and Varisian will be encountered throughout the campaign, but its
						speakers will often also speak Common or Polyglot. Other languages may feature incidentally, but may not be
						the ideal choice when choosing a new one to learn.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><b>Prejudice:</b> Different towns have different feelings towards adventurers, and
						the native Mwangi have as much difficulty distinguishing inconsiderate adventurers from the colonists as the
						colonists have distinguishing one Mwangi tribe from another. Generally, however, all non-Mwangi are treated
						the same, which is usually better than the native Mwangi peoples are treated as they are rarely considered
						equals and are often either second-class citizens if not outright slaves. When exposed to xenophobia, it is
						usually in both directions across this divide, though some colonials look down on adventurers as
						troublemakers, not much different than the pirates that frequent their towns and shipyards.</li>

					<li style="list-style-type: none; display: none;"><b>Click to Obscure Knowledge Uses:</b></li>
					<li style="display: none;"><b>All: Monster Identification</b> - Most Knowledge's allow for identifying

				<h2>The 10 Commandments of Tomb Raiding</h2>
				<ol reversed>
					<li style="list-style-type: none;"><b>Click to Reveal the Tomb Raiding Commandments:</b></li>
					<li style="list-style-type: none; display: none;"><b>Click to Apostatize the Tomb Raiding Commandments:</b>
					</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><b>Scout Ahead:</b> <i>(Recommended Skill - Linguistics)</i> Before opening doors
						or rounding corners, gather as much information as you can. Deciphering ancient writings or maps can provide
						a massive advantage. Using magic to create maps, scry, or see through walls is incredible, but even
						listening at a door, using a mirror to look around a corner, peering through a crack in the wall, or
						(dangerously) sneaking ahead to take a peek, can all gather useful information about who to fight, what to
						prepare, when to move, or where to stand. </li>
					<li style="display: none;"><b>Use Diplomacy:</b> <i>(Recommended Skill - Diplomacy)</i> There are more ways to
						deal with a monster than dangerous combat. Diplomacy can turn a dangerous encounter into an unexpected ally,
						and even unreasonable monsters might be persuaded (or tricked) with food, gold, magic items, or spells.
						Encounters bypassed are encounters overcome, and resources saved now are resources for later.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><b>Understand the Environment:</b> <i>(Recommended Skill - Knowledge)</i> Many
						dungeons have their own hazards, curses, terrain, or even political dynamics. Understanding who to negotiate
						with, what creatures lurk below, when to delve, where to find the treasure, how to avoid falling, or why you
						shouldn't touch the water can all be lifesaving.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><b>Break Down Doors:</b> <i>(Recommended Skill - Initiative)</i> While there is a
						time for quiet in a dungeon, there is also a time for action. When loot is identified or creatures are heard
						on the other side of a door, acting quickly can often end a fight before it even starts. When it comes to
						combat, hesitation is a character trait that is rarely rewarded.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><b>Search for Secrets:</b> <i>(Recommended Skill - Perception)</i> It often pays to
						be thorough, especially in ancient or powerful places. Small trinkets may hide powerful magic, secret
						passages may bypass danger, and treasures are often hidden away, buried by rubble, or disguised as something
						mundane (like furniture). Watch for tell-tale signs of monster activity which may give insight into the
						dungeon environment ahead.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><b>Check for Traps:</b> <i>(Recommended Skill - Disable Device)</i> Monster lairs
						and ancient tombs are often warded with traps and curses. A keen eye, particularly on doors and chests, as
						well as the occasional use of spells like <i>Detect Magic</i> will often feel unrewarded, but occasionally
						prevent a horrible death. Watch for monsters disguising their undead or monstrous features while feigning
						innocence in an effort to lure you closer.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><b>Be Prepared:</b> <i>(Recommended Skill - Climb/Swim)</i> Rope, pitons, tools,
						torches, mirrors, waterproof bags, ten-foot poles. <i>Detect Magic, Dimension Door, Light, Levitation,
							Summon Monster, Silent Image, Unseen Servant.</i> Whether you need a way up, down, or out, or you just
						need some fodder to distract a monster while you run, entering a dungeon unprepared is a way to die alone in
						the dark.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><b>Set Traps:</b> <i>(Recommended Skill - Craft)</i> Never forget to set traps of
						your own as you try to create a safe place. Ball bearings, strings, nets, oil, and more provide all the
						basics for building a safe place to fall back on, and clever crafter's and powerful conjurers can do far
						more to prepare a place for combat. Just as its easy to be led into a trap, only the most intelligent of
						monsters will even suspect a trap, meaning traps are a reliable way to gain an advantage.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><b>Stay Stealthy:</b> <i>(Recommended Skill - Stealth)</i> Staying stealthy can
						lead to gaining information, bypassing danger, and surprising an enemy in combat. Do not explore more than
						one room at once, and do not break line of sight for too long - if ever - but even pushing forward safely
						one-by-one can make a huge difference.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><b>Never Split the Party:</b> <i>(Recommended Skill - Survival)</i> It is dangerous
						to go alone. Don't leave line-of-sight or communication for long - if ever - and don't scout physically
						ahead without a plan of when they will come looking for you. Only rest in safe places, avoiding places out
						in the open or cornered with only a single way out, and keep someone on watch - preferably multiple
						someone's - at all times.</li>

					<li><b>Click to Fold-up the Native Tribes' Forward:</b></li>
					<li>While colonists find it difficult to distinguish between the
						various tribes and ethno-linguistic groups in Mwangi, the local tribespeople recognize distinctions every
						bit as definitive as those between Ulfen and Taldan - and most all of them bristle at being lumped together
						colloquially as simply "natives." Those that interact with them frequently realize there are six major
						heritages within the blanket Mwangi ethnicity, each containing a handful of dominant tribes:</li>
				</ul>
				<!-- <br> -->
				<ul class="toggleLiVis" style="list-style-type: circle;">
					<li style="list-style-type: none;"><b>Bekyar - The Raiders:</b></li>
					<li style="list-style-type: none; display: none;"><b>Click to Flee from the Bekyar...</b></li>
					<li style="display: none;">
						<picture>
							<source srcset="/serpents/images/tribe-bekyar.webp" type="image/webp">
							<img class="tooTall" src="/serpents/images/unknown.png" alt="Bekyar Tribeswoman">
						</picture>
						Bekyar tend to be tall, and their hairstyles often involve long and elaborate braids, sometimes
						incorporating silk headwraps. The majority of the Bekyar peoples hunt for game and raid other communities
						for food, resources, and - most importantly - people. What they do with their captives varies by tribe,
						which tend to fall under one of two subcategories:
						<ul style="list-style-type: lower-greek;">
							<li style="display: none;"><i>Bandu -</i> These slavers infest the Bandu Hills, which are in turn named
								after this tribe, turning an already dangerous and hostile area into one fraught with enough peril that
								few brave the territory, despite the promised riches. Much of their civil dealings with outsiders is
								limited to human trafficking - either buying a slave or a captives freedom. Since the colonization of
								Sargava, they have come to view the light-skinned foreigners as emissaries of the "northern gods," and
								as such they particularly prize these captives as sacrifices to their nature spirit deities.</li>
							<li style="display: none;"><i>Yemba -</i> The Yemba are a smaller tribe rarely encountered by colonists
								but often spoken of in ghost stories as they are, if accounts are accurate, cannibals. The Yemba (whose
								name translates to ghoul) supposedly live along the River of Lost Tears and its many tributaries, and
								can be found by following the sounds of beating drums deep in the dark forests at night, where they can
								be encountered feasting upon human flesh in a ritual presided over by witch doctors known only as the
								"Yemba-bo" or "Ghoul-talkers".</li>
							<li style="list-style-type: none; display: none;" class="clearfix"></li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<ul class="toggleLiVis" style="list-style-type: circle;">
					<li style="list-style-type: none;"><b>Bonuwat - the Seafaring:</b></li>
					<li style="list-style-type: none; display: none;"><b>Click for the Bonuwat to Set Sail...</b></li>
					<li style="display: none;">
						<picture>
							<source srcset="/serpents/images/tribe-bonuwat.webp" type="image/webp">
							<img class="tooTall" src="/serpents/images/unknown.png" alt="Bonuwat Tribesman">
						</picture>
						Bonuwat mostly appear along the coastline and are typically shirtless, sometimes wearing paint instead of
						cloth, and they usually keep their hair cropped short, in cornrows, or shaved for the sake of being
						hydrodynamic. The Bonuwat have a seafaring heritage, and their communities pop up everywhere both water and
						fish can be found. These people tend to fall under one of two subcategories:
						<ul style="list-style-type: lower-greek;">
							<li style="display: none;"><i>Ijo -</i> Perhaps the friendliest of the local tribes, the Ijo spend their
								days on the open waters. Their tendency to dress in little more than loincloths is a source of
								embarrassment to some of the more genteel colonials, but it is a matter of simplicity to the Ijo who
								spend most of their time either in or on the water under the hot sun. They sell their daily catch all
								across Sargava and maintain cordial relations with most colonials and tribespeople, keeping their
								clashes on and under the sea.</li>
							<li style="display: none;"><i>Ombo -</i> These merchants have loosely aligned themselves with the pirates
								of the Shackles and have adopted much of their sense of style, often wearing loose-fitting pantaloons
								and jewelry, and little else. They have found the slave trade to be particularly lucrative, often
								trading captives with the Free Captains on behalf of the Bandu, and occasionally preying upon the Ijo
								when they're found alone in open water.</li>
							<li style="list-style-type: none; display: none;" class="clearfix"></li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<ul class="toggleLiVis" style="list-style-type: circle;">

							<img class="tooTall" src="/serpents/images/unknown.png" alt="Caldaru Tribeswoman">
						</picture>
						With skin tones ranging from olive to dark bronze, the Caldaru dress in long, flowing robes that take in the
						breeze and cool the skin. Believing themselves to be the chosen people, the majority of their people were
						enslaved or dispersed when outsiders first reached the Mwangi Expanse. Rather than assimilating, they have
						absorbed much of the knowledge of these far-flung communities while maintaining their identity, setting up
						their own communities to trade and sell their expertise. These diaspora congregate close to one-another
						wherever they are found, looking forward to one day establishing a kingdom in a city of their own.

						</picture>
						The Mauxi typically wear head wraps to protect themselves from the sun while favoring a variety of colorful
						robes and textiles. These people are typically nomadic and peaceful, but ready to defend themselves. The
						mauxi are further subcategorized by the heard animals they follow across the expanse, with the following two
						being predominant:
						<ul style="list-style-type: lower-greek;">
							<li style="display: none;"><i>Bas'o -</i> These Mauxi follow the antelope heard in and out of Sargava, not
								caring for the borders drawn by the colonials anymore than the herds mind them. While peaceful, they
								have learned to be distrustful of strangers, and are not to be trifled with, having a deeply ingrained
								warrior culture ready to react violently to perceived challenges or threats.</li>
							<li style="display: none;"><i>Elephant People -</i> Scattered groups of nomads living alongside their
								elephant companions, these groups are collectively known as the elephant people. While not numerous,
								their incorporation of mighty elephant cavalry alongside ivory spears make them dangerous to challenge.
								The communities have themselves forgotten their ancestral name, having thought of themselves as
								"elephants in man-skin" for generations.</li>
							<li style="list-style-type: none; display: none;" class="clearfix"></li>

						<picture>
							<source srcset="/serpents/images/tribe-vidric.webp" type="image/webp">
							<img class="tooTall" src="/serpents/images/unknown.png" alt="Vidric Mulaa or Kalabuta Native">
						</picture>
						With a skin tone ranging from fair to ebony, the Vidric people are those who have spent generations under
						colonial rule (either willingly or as servants), and after generations of intermixing and learning the ways
						of their colonizers, they no longer identify with the ethnic traditions or heritages of their ancestors.
						These people tend to wear a mix of Chelish and Mwangi clothing and worship gods from the inner sea (but with
						decidedly Mwangi traits). The name "Vidric" is derived from the ancestral name of modern Sargava, and those
						who visibly support independence or revolutionary movements tent to wear chains or a pair of chain-less
						bracelets, though some view this tendency as tacky or confrontational. While they no longer have truly
						distinct heritages, they can be further subcategorized slightly:
						<ul style="list-style-type: lower-greek;">
							<li style="display: none;"><i>Colonial Natives -</i> These people are descended from Chelish colonists,
								but were born and raised in Sargava, it being the only country and culture they know. While the culture
								and traditions of the inner sea are dominant amongst them, their style and lifestyle are shaped by their
								new environment. Many colonial natives speak polyglot (though it would be scandalous if they couldn't
								also speak proper common), and some have incorporated local religious adaptations into their own
								beliefs. Generations ago, it was disgraceful to intermix with the local Mwangi, but today intermarriages

							<li style="display: none;"><i>Mulaa -</i> The Mulaa people are those whose ancestors come from Eleder and
								the M'neri Plains, and their culture has been shaped by their peaceful interactions with the bonuwat and
								zenj, alongside generations of being preyed upon by the Bekyar. The first group to be conquered by
								Cheliax when they established sargava, they are also the most fully integrated, and while they occupy
								the lower rungs of society in Eleder, the majority of them make up Sargava's middle class.</li>
							<li style="display: none;"><i>Kalabuta -</i> The Kalabuta people are those who have lived in Kalabuto for
								generations, and while they have come to identify with the colonists more than their own heritage, they
								still retain some cultural idiosyncrasies. Their numbers and distance from the rest of sargava have also
								given them more independence than their Mulaa counterparts, though they're proximity to the Bandu Hills,
								the Mzali, and the Screaming Jungle makes their lives decidedly more dangerous. The vast majority of the
								Kalabuta remarkably poor.</li>

						While closely related and sharing many customs, the Zenj are clearly divided between the matriarchal
						savannah dwelling Zenje and the patriarchal jungle dwelling Zenju. Despite their differences, the Zenj
						typically see themselves as one people who happen to be living in different communities, and they often
						trade freely, celebrate together, and even come to one another's defense or aid, though they rarely
						inter-marry due to cultural differences regarding gender. Legend says that long ago they were one tribe when
						a patriarch who was afraid of hunting a predator insisted that a vegetarian diet was far healthier, causing
						the two groups to split. While pronounced the same, the details of these two subcategories are as follows:
						<ul style="list-style-type: lower-greek;">
							<li style="display: none;"><i>Zenje -</i> The semi-nomadic matriarchs of the savannah, these people move
								between settlements they have constructed that they only occupy for a few months at a time, following
								the herds of their prey. The most popular Zenje fashions incorporate animal skins, with rarer animals
								denoting ones status.</li>
							<li style="display: none;"><i>Zenju -</i> The highly stationary patriarchs of the jungle, these people
								live in long homes and live an agricultural lifestyle. They tend to wear simple textiles and are well
								known for medicinal herbs, making them tempting targets for Bekyar raiders, and for knowing how to
								safely cook foods that are ordinarily poisonous - often morbidly joking with outsiders about the chefs
								lack of skills while they dine on the ordinarily-deadly meals. </li>

						Amongst the native Mwangi <b>Humans</b>, the Lirgeni, Mzali, Uomoto, and Yamasan peoples occupy various
						settlements far outside of sargava, and consider themselves distinct tribes, though they typically share a
						heritage with one of the other major groups:
						<ul style="list-style-type: lower-greek;">
							<li style="display: none;"><i>Elves -</i> The <b>Elves</b> native to the Mwangi expanse are collectively
								known as the Mualijae, though they have splintered into three distinct groups: the Alijae, Ekujae, and
								Kallijae. According to their oral tradition, their ancestors stayed behind at the time of earthfall
								instead of returning to Sovyrian - the home of the elves - having been given a charge to protect
								golarion from Dahak - the great darkness. The Ekujae claim their ancestors defeated Dahak, at the cost
								of many lives, and they remain vigilant against its prophesied return, guarding its eternal prison. The
								Kallijae claim their ancestors failed and the Dahak possessed them, and only by eschewing violence and
								purifying themselves can they keep the Dahak contained. The Alijae, meanwhile, broke with tradition and
								wrote their stories down - according to them, the truth is somewhere in the middle - the Dahak was
								severely wounded but was unable to be defeated, and instead began controlling its elven captors, and
								they have been on a mission to study the Dahak and learn how to destroy it, once and for all.</li>
							<li style="display: none;"><i>Dwarves -</i> The native <b>Dwarves</b> are
								typically either of the Mbe'ke or Taralu clans if they didn't sail in with the colonists. The Mbe'ke
								clan live very traditional dwarven lifestyles and are descendants of the people of High King Nkobe, who
								subjugated a clan of cloud dragons; meanwhile, the Taralu clan no longer practice most dwarven
								traditions, instead engaging in totemism and both ancestor, dragon, and star worship, revering the
								magic-ravaged cloud dragon named Tanin and swearing to keep and mediate peace at all times.</li>
							<li style="display: none;"><i>Other Core Races -</i> Rarely native Song'o halflings or Matanji orcs are
								encountered, but the sight of one is the exception to the expectation. Most other inner-sea races,
								including <b>Gnomes</b> and most <b>Halflings</b>, <b>Half-Elves</b>, and <b>Half-Orcs</b> are not
								native to the area but some (particularly <b>Gnomes</b>) have come in droves with the colonists. </li>
							<li style="display: none;"><i>Other Races -</i> There are also communities of several other intelligent
								(but not always humanoid) races native to the expanse - most of whom are hostile - including:
								<b>Anadi</b>, <b>Biloko</b>, <b>Boggard</b>, <b>Catfolk</b>, <b>Charau-Ka</b>, <b>Conrasu</b>,
								<b>Gnoll</b>, <b>Goloma</b>, <b>Grippli</b>, <b>Kaava</b>, <b>Ketch</b>, <b>Kobold</b>, <b>Leshy</b>,
								<b>Lizardfolk</b>, <b>Mbaiki</b>, <b>Sabosan</b>, and <b>Shisk</b>. There is also a relative abundance
								of intelligent flora and fauna (especially amongst the Apes and Gorillas), as well as fevered rumors of
								both <b>Planar Scions</b> and <b>Serpentfolk</b>, those these are likely tall-tales.

				<h3>Where We Are Now: The Korir River</h3>
				<picture>
					<source srcset="/serpents/images/sketch-great-river.webp" type="image/webp">
					<img class="pointer" src="/serpents/images/unknown.png" alt="The Korir River" loading="lazy">
				</picture>
				<p>Known to the locals simply as "The River," this river flows through the entirety of the Mwangi Expanse,
					flowing down from the shattered range, through the jungles and hills, past countless ruined civilizations, and
					emptying in to the ocean to the west through large delta's. The word "Korir" is a portmanteau of the polyglot
					words for Serpent's Tears, suggesting a river that is winding, sorrowful, and endless.
					The large number of waterfalls and rapids coupled with the jungle terrain make both navigation and portaging
					difficult, and while this does reduce the number of crocodiles, hippopotamuses, and enchanted dolphins
					frequently encountered, it does have the added threat of large snakes dropping on passing prey from branches
					hanging over the river.</p>
				<p>Few explorers dare navigate the waters all the way to the shattered range, and none have successfully managed
					to bridge the gap and sail from one end of the continent to the other. While the shattered range is the most
					obvious perilous obstacle, most explorers get lost just traveling through the screaming jungle, with its heavy
					daily rains, low obscuring fog, endless chattering monkeys, and heavy dreams which pull people into fevered
					nightmares and sleeping sickness. Fatigue takes many, and eventually, sleep takes all. It is said that all
					people dream of the jungle and its treasures...</p>

				<h3>Destination: Ruins of Tazion</h3>
				<picture>
					<source srcset="/serpents/images/hero-tazion.webp" type="image/webp">
					<img class="pointer" src="/serpents/images/unknown.png" alt="Ruins of Tazion" loading="lazy">
				</picture>
				<p> The ruins of Tazion stand as a remnant of a forgotten age, an outpost of ancient Azlant lost in the southern
					Mwangi Jungle. Little remains within its walls, with most of the settlement having crumbled or been buried
					centuries before. The majority of Tazion’s structures remain unidentifiable. Centuries of weathering and
					erosion have transformed the once-splendid architecture into little more than scattered stones, curious
					topography, and fetid tar pits. Few could have ever suspected that the ruins possess the key to finding the
					lost city of Saventh-Yhi, and its secrets are ripe for the taking.</p>
				<p>Rumor says that a tribe of ape-men, known as charau-ka, now inhabit the ruins, though they wouldn't share its
					secrets in the unlikely event they discovered any. From the ruins, they have reportedly established a temple
					in the shape of a serpent's skull; this temple is now the ape-men’s main encampment, where they gather to
					share information and deposit relics they have found in the ruins as offerings to their new snake-god.</p>
				<p>The Charau-Ka are dangerous, xenophobic abominations, whose very name translates from polyglot to
					"Beware-Them," though it is unclear if they are named after the phrase, or if the phrase exist because of the
					abominations. As mysterious as they are dangerous, and as fetid as they are strong, it is unwise to try to
					communicate with them, as while semi-intelligent, they are unlikely to speak unless they can use speaking to
					bait their victims into a trap. Those who find themselves encircled by Charau-Ka frequently take their own
					lives to prevent capture, out of fear of being brutalized and transformed into another of their kind.</p>

				<h3>Sargava at a Glance</h3>
				<picture>
					<source srcset="/serpents/images/map-sargava.webp" type="image/webp">
					<img class="pointer" src="/serpents/images/unknown.png" alt="Sargavan Territorial Map" loading="lazy">
				</picture>
				<p>Beset by devil-binding pilgrims and inescapable debts to pirate lords, as well as generations of resentment
					from the nation’s subjugated indigenous peoples, the colony of Sargava remains a bastion of northern culture
					and civilization in the heart of the southern wilds. Once part of a vast and mighty empire long since fallen
					to dust, as evidenced by the crumbling ruins still lurking beneath the veneer of lush farmland and verdant
					jungle, Sargava’s rich landscape is home to fierce Mwangi natives and even fiercer predators of the deep
					jungle, as well as a dwindling population of northern colonials who seek to uphold their ideals of culture and
					breeding at all cost, straining against the tides of resentment that may soon sweep them into the sea and
					return the land to its original owners.</p>
				<p>Founded over 500 years ago by Prince Haliad I as part of Cheliax’s expansionist Everwar, Sargava stood as the
					jewel of the empire for centuries. But when Aroden died, the empire was thrown into chaos, and Sargava’s ruler
					backed the wrong house in the Chelish Civil War. House Thrune took control of Cheliax and sent a flotilla of
					warships to retake the colony that had supported their enemy in the bloody conflict. Grand Custodian Grallus
					anticipated the onslaught, however, and made a fateful alliance with the Free Captains of the Shackles.
					Swooping out of Desperation Bay to pounce on the unsuspecting Chelish Navy, the pirates’ superior fleet
					swiftly ended the threat to their southern neighbor, and extracted a mighty price from Sargava for their
					efforts. To this day, vast portions of Sargava’s wealth flow into the Free Captains’ coffers for past
					assistance and assurance of continued naval protection.</p>
				<p>Financially weakened by the Free Captains’ high demands and cut off from many of their former trade partners
					to the north, Sargava faces an even larger threat from within. The native Mwangi people, inspired by the
					teachings of a mysterious, undead child-god in the nearby city-state of Mzali, move ever closer to open
					rebellion to free themselves from colonial rule. While Cheliax no longer has an official stake in Sargava’s
					government, the colonial Sargavan minority maintains control of the vastly larger native population. But the
					natives know that they have the resources of the entire Mwangi Expanse at their backs, and that Grand
					Custodian Utilinus’s government is in a poor position to quell a rebellion.</p>
