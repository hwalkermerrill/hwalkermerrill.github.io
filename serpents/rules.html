						&nbsp;“When foreigners think of Hell, they think of jagged stone and lakes of fire. But they’re wrong. A
						sharp rock is a blessing when the other option is quicksand and tangled mangrove roots that try to suck you
						down beneath the brown sludge. Fire is a blessing when the air is so wet that you drown standing up, its hot
						soup draining into your lungs with the funk of a thousand rotting plants. Give me the clean kiss of a
						devil’s lash over the festering rot that eats your toes and eyes, or the flies that burrow through your skin
						and lay their maggots in your flesh.
						<br>&nbsp;"No, Hell is a jungle, and those who forget it once won’t live to do so again."

					<li style="list-style-type: none; display: none;"><b>IRL Table Rules:</b></li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Late</i> - If you know your running late, please bring food for the table or
						drinks for the drink fridge.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Rolling Dice</i> - Dice need to be rolled on the table (or through an app) in
						plain view. If a player's dice fall off the table, they may call "Jumanji" before looking at it to take the
						result of the roll. Otherwise, they must re-roll.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Snack Table</i> - A snack table and drink fridge are provided with caution -
						anything on the table or in the fridge is fair game.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Swearing</i> - Do your best to avoid swearing (we know its hard sometimes).</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Taking Breaks</i> - Try to take breaks every hour or so (stretch, pee, grab
						snacks, etc.)</li>
				</ul>
				<ul class="toggleLiVis" style="list-style-type: circle;">
					<li style="list-style-type: none;"><b>In-Game Table Rules</b></li>
					<li style="list-style-type: none; display: none;"><b>In-Game Table Rules:</b></li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Any Last Words?</i> - Players (and optionally NPCs) get a chance to say any
						"last words" as a death monologue when they die if they move from conscious to dead in a single turn, with a
						word limit equal to their constitution score. They may also choose to say their "last words" when knocked
						unconscious but not immediately killed, though they are not obligated to do so.
						<br>&emsp; - Mindless undead may be found repeating their last words.
					</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Arachnophobia Mod</i> - Spiders in game will usually be referred to as bears,
						though they keep all their base form stats (webs, poison, climbing, etc), and pictures will be subbed for
						pictures of bears. If your confused about what kind of bear the GM is describing, you can ask. Otherwise, be
						on the look out for bears of diminutive -> gigantic size with webs.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Circumstantial RP</i> - Players may occasionally gain a +2 circumstance bonus to
						their roll for good RP, with new players receiving this bonus more often.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Companions</i> - Animal Companions, Cohorts, Familiars, and Mounts that are not
						placed on the board at the beginning of combat cannot die or take actions.
						<br>&emsp; - The above companions act on your initiative. They only use their own initiative if they are in
						a separate combat from you.
					</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Critical Kills</i> - Players get to describe how their character kills an enemy
						that they kill with a critical hit.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Deific Bargains</i> - Players may attempt to bargain with deities at their
						altars. While good deities often just grant their boons freely, neutral and evil deities will often require
						something in exchange, with evil deities known for twisting the request.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Experience Pool</i> - Experience points are given to the party in the form of a
						shared pool, which may be used to push individual characters higher. No player may be more than 1 level
						ahead of the rest of the party.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>First Session Re-spec</i> - After your first session with any character (between
						games), you may re-spec choices/aspects that you feel aren't working.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Golden Hare</i> - Players with a portion of their backstory that is "too dark to
						explain" are haunted by an immortal glowing golden bunny until they complete their backstory.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Hex Maps</i> - This table uses hexes to measure distances, where 1 hex always
						equals 5ft. and the radius of effects are determined linearly. Concealment and Cover are determined via
						imaginary lines from the center of the origin to the center of the target, and attacks must be exactly
						opposite each other relative to the target for flanking. For more information on hexes, consult the Core
						Rule Book (CRB).</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Late Arrival</i> - If you walk into a session late, you do not get an update on
						what's happened from the GM save for a single perception check. You may then ask in-character for more
						information from the other players.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Life Flashes before their Eyes</i> - The first time in an encounter a creature
						becomes disabled (or worse) their life "flashes before their eyes" just before they take damage. When this
						happens, they get flashbacks of what brought them here, which may serve as a catalytic event if one is
						pending. Players are encouraged to recount some of their character's backstory.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>New Characters</i> - If your old character dies or retires, your new character
						comes in at Average Party Level (APL) - 1.</li>

				<h3>Implemented Variant Rule Systems</h3>
				<ul class="toggleLiVis" style="list-style-type: circle;">
					<li style="list-style-type: none;"><b>Combat Maneuvers Rework</b></li>
					<li style="list-style-type: none; display: none;"><b>Combat Maneuvers Rework:</b></li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>What is This?</i> - Combat Maneuvers have been tweaked and their rules have been
						unified here from multiple sources (DPG, CRB, EitR) for simplicity. Combat Maneuvers now fall into the
						following major categories: Deft Maneuvers, Fighting Dirty, Grappling, and Powerful Maneuvers. In each case,
						the Improved Combat Maneuver feat for each category merges and replaces the former individual Improved
						Combat Manuever feats, but all Greater Combat Manuever feats must be taken for each maneuver individually.
					</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Charging</i> - Unchanged, but clarified: You must move at least 10ft. to charge;
						You may charge by flying down, falling, or swinging from a rope or vine, but to do so you must move at least
						20ft. and you must have started at a higher elevation. You may not (normally) charge through difficult
						terrain or another creatures square, and must end in the closest square in range of the target from your
						point of origin, in a straight line. You may substitute a powerful maneuver for an attack on a charge. You
						may only do a partial charge when limited to a standard action or as a readied action.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Deft Maneuvers</i> - A Deft Maneuver is any maneuver you perform with a weapon,
						namely Disarm, Drag, Reposition, Sunder, and Trip. You need the Deft Maneuvers feat to perform any deft
						maneuver without provoking an attack of opportunity. You may substitute any attack for a deft maneuver as
						part of a full attack or attack of opportunity, using your BAB for that attack as your BAB on that maneuver.
						You may add any enhancement bonuses from your weapon to your deft maneuvers, and conversely you take a -4
						penalty on your check if attempting one without using a weapon. If you attempt a deft maneuver with a
						finesse weapon, you may use your DEX instead of STR for your CMB. The disarm and sunder special weapon
						qualities provide a +2 bonus to those specific maneuvers, while if you fail either of those checks by 10 or
						more, you drop your weapon. You are also knocked prone if you fail a drag, reposition, or trip attempt by
						10 or more unless the weapon possess the deft (trip) quality, which allows the wielder to drop the weapon
						instead.
						<ul style="list-style-type: lower-greek;">
							<li style="display: none;">Sunder - This maneuver is both a powerful and deft maneuver, but powerful
								maneuvers is required for greater sunder feats.</li>
							<li style="display: none;">Trip - A creature that succeeds at a trip combat manuever only knocks the
								target to kneeling or sitting. If they exceed the targets CMD by 5 or more, they are instead knocked
								prone. A creature performing this manuever may attempt to only knock their target to kneeling or
								sitting. Forcing a creature to kneel or sit counts as knocking them prone for the purposes of spells and
								effects.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Fighting Dirty</i> - Dirty Trick and Steal combat maneuvers, along with the
						Feint social maneuver are all unique standard actions that are considered fighting dirty. Fighting dirty is
						not evil but is considered dishonorable. The Dirty Fighting feat is required to perform a Dirty Trick or
						Steal combat maneuver without provoking an attack of opportunity, as well as allowing you to Feint as a move
						action.
						<ul style="list-style-type: lower-greek;">
							<li style="display: none;"> Dirty Trick - This maneuver can also inflict the off-balance condition. </li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Grappling</i> - Grappling is an advanced combat maneuver you may attempt as a
						standard action or in place of an attack of opportunity. You need improved unarmed strike to initiate a
						grapple without provoking an attack of opportunity. You take a -4 penalty on grapple checks if you’re
						holding a weapon. If you are grappled, you may attempt to break or reverse the grapple as a grapple combat
						maneuver, escape the grapple the grapple as an escape artist check, attempt to cast a spell with no somatic
						components, or attack with a one handed or finesse weapon. If you wish to maintain a grapple you control,
						you must first attempt the grapple with a +5; if you succeed, you may choose from a list of effects to apply
						to the target. An outsider may “dog pile” a grappled target, giving the grappler a +2 bonus to their CMB and
						CMD as though aided until the grapple is released. An outsider may also attempt to wrench a grappled target
						free by attempting a grapple check against the controllers CMD +5; if they succeed, the grapple ends.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Powerful Maneuvers</i> - Powerful Maneuvers are all standard actions which may
						be done as part of a charge or attack of opportunity, which include the Hamstring, Overrun, Shove (Bull
						Rush), and Sunder combat maneuvers. You can only perform any of these maneuvers against an opponent who is
						no more that one size category larger than you. You need the Powerful Maneuvers feat to perform one of these
						maneuvers without provoking an attack of opportunity from your target. If you fail any powerful maneuver by
						5 or more, you are knocked prone.
						<ul style="list-style-type: lower-greek;">
							<li style="display: none;"><i>Hamstring</i> - (Unified Feats as New Combat Maneuver) You attempt to
								hamstring your opponent’s movement. If your attack exceeds the target’s CMD, the target is entangled for
								1 round. For every 5 by which your attack exceeds your opponent’s CMD, the penalty lasts 1 additional
								round. Creatures that are immune to critical hits cannot be hamstrung. Flying creatures can be
								hamstrung, but only if they use non-magical means of flight. </li>
							<li style="display: none;"><i>Overrun</i> - When you successfully overrun a target and move through their
								space, you also force them to kneel or sit, unless you knock them prone by exceeding their CMD by 5 or
								more.
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<ul class="toggleLiVis" style="list-style-type: circle;">
					<li style="list-style-type: none;"><b>Elephant in the Room (EitR)</b></li>
					<li style="list-style-type: none; display: none;"><b>Elephant in the Room (EitR):</b></li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i><a href="https://meliogeny.net/square-world/">Hero Lab Instal Link</a></i></li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Class, Combat, and Equipment Rework</i> - Approved. Classes that grant
						abilities/proficiency with a specific weapon still only grant benefits to that specific weapon. Nonlethal
						damage may be dealt without penalty from lethal weapons, but not vice-versa.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Combat Stance</i> - Before making attacks, you must determine your combat
						stance; you can only use one combat stance per turn. Universally, the Accurate (default) and Total Defense
						stances can be used by any creature, while the Power and Defensive stances can be used by any creature with
						a BAB of +1 or higher. Combat stances are separate from combat styles and may be used in conjunction. Feats
						and abilities that modify the replaced feats apply to the new stances.
						<ul style="list-style-type: lower-greek;">
							<li style="display: none;"><i>Accurate Stance</i> - (Default stance) Has no changes to AC, ATK, or DMG.
							</li>
							<li style="display: none;"><i>Defensive Stance</i> - (Replaces Combat Expertise and Fighting Defensively)
								You trade a -1 penalty to ATK for a +1 dodge bonus to AC. At BAB +4 and every four thereafter, you
								increase the penalty and bonus of each by 1.</li>
							<li style="display: none;"><i>Power Stance</i> - (Replaces Deadly Aim, Power Attack, and Piranha Strike)
								You trade a -1 penalty to ATK for a +2 bonus to DMG. At BAB +4 and every four thereafter, you increase
								the penalty by 1 and the bonus by 2. This bonus is multiplied alongside the strength bonus to weapon
								damage for the weapon being held in one or two hands, if that multiplier applies.</li>
							<li style="display: none;"><i>Total Defense</i> - (Adjusted) Declaring Total Defense is a standard action,
								which prevents you from making attacks of any kind until your next turn. This grants a +4 dodge bonus to
								AC (increases to +6 with 3+ ranks in acrobatics) and you do not provoke attacks of opportunity for any
								actions taken in your starting square or for leaving that square, though any further movements may
								provoke normally.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Feat Adjustments and Changes</i> - Approved with annotations (see master feat
						changes section).</li>
				</ul>
				<ul class="toggleLiVis" style="list-style-type: circle;">
					<li style="list-style-type: none;"><b>Firearms Redux</b></li>
					<li style="list-style-type: none; display: none;"><b>Firearms Redux:</b></li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Availability</i> - This campaign allows the purchase of primitive firearms.
						Advanced firearms can only be acquired as a specific loot drop. Modern firearms are prohibited.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Bulletproof</i> - Creatures wearing adamantine armor or wielding an adamantine
						shield, creatures with 25+ natural armor, or creatures possessing DR/-, DR/adamantine, or DR/epic of any
						amount, are not subject to the armor-penetrating qualities of firearms or siege weapons, and those weapons
						attack their regular AC.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Bullet-Resistant</i> - A firearm or siege weapon must be at least +1 to
						penetrate (and ignore) heavy shields and medium armor, and they must be at least +2 to penetrate tower
						shields or heavy armor. Creatures with natural armor equal to or greater than 5x the weapons enhancement
						bonus (minimum 5) are also not penetrated.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Fatal Dice</i> - (2e) All firearms gain Fatal Dice: When a critical hit is
						confirmed against a creature, the damage die increases two steps before damage is rolled.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Penetration</i> - (2e) All firearms gain Penetration: When a natural 20 is
						rolled when using a bullet (regardless of whether or not the attack is a critical hit), and the firearm is
						successfully penetrating the targets armor, the shot penetrates the target and continues on the same
						trajectory until it passes through the square of a creature or object, up to a total maximum distance
						traveled of the weapons first range increment. If the bullet passes through another creatures square, the
						shooter makes an attack against that target at a -2, while if it collides with an object it simply deals
						damage. Bullets may penetrate through multiple targets.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Siege Weapons</i> - (2e) All siege weapons gain the ability to target touch AC
						as though they were a firearm. All piercing siege weapons also gain the Penetration ability of firearms. All
						siege weapon with a x3 or x4 critical also gain the Fatal Dice ability of firearms.</li>
				</ul>
				<ul class="toggleLiVis" style="list-style-type: circle;">
					<li style="list-style-type: none;"><b>Hero Points</b></li>
					<li style="list-style-type: none; display: none;"><b>Hero Points:</b></li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Gaining Hero Points</i> - Every character starts with one, and gains one each
						time they level. They also gain hero points following the holidays calendar rules, on their birthday, and
						rarely as rewards for things (such as completing major story arcs, a deific boon, performing particularly
						heroic acts, etc.)</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Limitations</i> - Maximum of 3 Hero points per character, which do not transfer
						between characters. You can only spend 1 hero point per encounter, except to cheat death. Spells, items, and
						abilities that affect hero point pools cannot be used by player characters.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Uses of Hero Points</i> - While the GM is the final arbiter of the extent of the
						power of a hero point, and may veto or adjudicate any use, these are some example uses.
						<ul style="list-style-type: lower-greek;">
							<li style="display: none;"><i>Act Out of Turn</i> - Move your initiative as though you had just
								un-delayed. You are restricted to one standard action (no swift), as though you were acting in a
								surprise round.</li>
							<li style="display: none;"><i>Cheat Death</i> <b>(THIS COSTS 3 HERO POINTS)</b> - When you would be slain,
								you can instead be reduced to 0hp (or current hp if lower) and stable. Whatever would have killed you
								will change targets to something else despite its instincts, if it can, unless you re-engage it.</li>
							<li style="display: none;"><i>Flashback (BitD)</i> - Have a flashback to a earlier time where one action
								was made (up to one roll), which can change the story going forward (ex. I bought a dose of holy water
								when we were last in town, I made arrangements for the duke to meet us here, I asked my contact to
								smuggle a lockpick into this room). <b>NOTE:</b> You cannot use this to change something that already
								happened (ex. actually i killed him in his sleep so he's already dead, I tied him up before we started
								combat.)</li>
							<li style="display: none;"><i>I Have an Idea</i> - Allows the attempt and <i>potential</i> success of
								something that would ordinarily be impossible, though that does not mean the attempt will work (ex. cast
								a spell you don't have but could otherwise cast, use foraged herbs instead of expensive spell
								components, wall-bounce out of a pit with using acrobatics instead of climb).</li>
							<li style="display: none;"><i>I Know a Guy</i> - Generate a previously unknown friendly npc/contact into
								existence, or generate a previously unknown skill in an existing npc of the GMs choosing.</li>
							<li style="display: none;"><i>Inspiration</i> - Receive divine inspiration (typically via the characters
								patron), getting a hint or instruction directly from the GM that they believe is helpful. If the GM has
								no advice, this doesn't cost a point.</li>
							<li style="display: none;"><i>Rally</i> - Lower your current fear level by one step.</li>
							<li style="display: none;"><i>Reroll</i> <b>(Most Common Use)</b> - Reroll any d20 roll you just made
								before the result is revealed.</li>
							<li style="display: none;"><i>Take-Backs</i> - Fix a mistake made earlier in your turn or within the last
								round (ex change movement, draw different weapon, forgot to use Power Stance, wanted to heal before the
								door was opened).</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<ul class="toggleLiVis" style="list-style-type: circle;">
					<li style="list-style-type: none;"><b>Mental Checks</b></li>
					<li style="list-style-type: none; display: none;"><b>Mental Checks:</b></li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>How they Work</i> - All mental checks are straight d20 rolls where the objective
						is to roll lower than or equal to your respective ability score. This is opposed to physical ability checks,
						which are straight d20 rolls plus the ability modifier. In these specific instances, rolling a natural 20 is
						always a failure.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Memory Checks (INT)</i> - Used to see if your character remembers something,
						even if the player doesn't.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Morale Checks (WIS)</i> - Used to see if a creatures morale breaks in a fight
						(see morale), adding any bonuses they have versus fear effects to their Wisdom score (like bravery).</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Chat Checks (Cha)</i> - Used to be conversation when the player doesn't want to
						role-play. This can include anything from general conversation at a party, to relaying information to an
						NPC, to giving a good come-back in a timely manner.</li>
				</ul>
				<ul class="toggleLiVis" style="list-style-type: circle;">
					<li style="list-style-type: none;"><b>Morale Checks</b></li>
					<li style="list-style-type: none; display: none;"><b>Morale Checks</b></li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>What is it?</i> - Morale checks determine when a creature loses their nerve in a
						fight.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Who rolls them?</i> - All players and creatures who are not mindless or immune
						to fear, have their own morale stat block, or are fighting to the death.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>When are they Rolled?</i> - When they become "Wounded" or "Disabled" in combat,
						their leader (or a friendly PC) is slain, or more than half their number are slain (if they don't have a
						leader).</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>What Happens on a Failure?</i> - They become "Shaken" until they rally or the
						end of the encounter.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>What about Rallying?</i> - Creatures get a morale check to rally if they are
						healed from "Wounded" or "Disabled" or their leader (or a PC) is brought back to life. They automatically
						rally if they are restored to full HP.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>When Morale Breaks</i> - When all creatures on one side of a fight is shaken (or
						worse) their morale breaks and they attempt to surrender or flee if they believe they can safely do so. If
						they cannot surrender or flee, they fight to the death.</li>
				</ul>

					<li style="list-style-type: none; display: none;"><b>Mounted Combat Rulings:</b></li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Adverse Movement</i> - Any effect that moves a mount without automatically
						moving the rider (Including Combat Manuevers) requires the rider to make a ride check (DC = moving effect +5
						OR CMB +5) or they fall off. If it moves the rider and not the mount, they always fall off.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Falling</i> - A mount and its rider both take equal damage from falls. When a
						mount falls or is knocked prone, the Rider must succeed on a DC25 Ride check to make a soft fall, or they
						take an additional 2d6 points of falling damage. If a rider falls onto their mount, their mount takes half
						the rider's falling damage.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>High Ground</i> - Riding a mount that is larger than an enemy provides high
						ground, but does not provide cover.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Ill-Suited</i> - In addition to taking a ride penalty, the rider loses their
						ability score bonus to initiative when riding an ill-suited mount.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Initiative</i> - The duo always moves on the rider's initiative.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Overrun</i> - A rider initiating an overrun may use his mount in place of
						himself, while providing the mount bonuses to overrun from the rider's feats and class features.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Prone Mont</i> - If a mount is knocked prone, the rider must make a DC25 ride
						check to make a soft fall, or they take 2d6 damage. If a rider takes any amount of damage from this, they
						fall off their mount.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Stacking</i> - A rider cannot simultaneously be a mount for a different
						creature, though a mount may potentially have both a rider and passengers.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Unconscious Rider</i> - If a rider is knocked unconscious, they have a 50%
						chance to stay in the saddle (75% chance if in a military saddle). Otherwise, they fall off and take an
						additional 2d6 points of damage. Without a rider to guide it, mounts avoid combat and obey their tricks.

					<li style="list-style-type: none;"><b>Perception Redux</b></li>
					<li style="list-style-type: none; display: none;"><b>Perception Redux:</b></li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Competing Skills</i> - Perception can be used to identify the correct skill to
						use, but cannot be used as a substitute for the correct skill. For example, perception might tell you a
						creature is wounded, but not the extent of the wounds (use heal); perception might notice signs of a hidden
						trail, but wont let you follow it (use survival).</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Detection</i> - (2e) Incorporate Detection Terminology
						<ul style="list-style-type: lower-greek;">
							<li style="display: none;"><i>Overview</i> - Detection determines how aware creatures are of each other.
								These states are relative to the viewer - its possible for a creature to be observed by you but hidden
								from your ally. Typically, the GM tracks how well creatures detect each other. Detection determines
								things like being caught off-guard, concealment, and surprise rounds, but are separate from things like
								cover. Higher states grant all the benefits of lower states, and use the lesser of conflicting
								penalties.</li>
							<li style="display: none;"><i>Observed</i> - You can "see" them, often without difficulty. You are not
								caught off-guard, you can attempt knowledge checks normally, and they cannot have total concealment
								(though they may have regular or improved concealment). If you are undetected or unnoticed, you get a
								surprise round if you initiate combat. Only precise senses (anything with sight or vision in its name)
								can observe a creature.</li>
							<li style="display: none;"><i>Hidden</i> - You have located a creature that is barely perceptible, and you
								know what space it occupies, but little else. Imprecise senses (such as scent or anything with "sense"
								in the name) can only raise detection up to this level.</li>
							<li style="display: none;"><i>Detected</i> - You know an enemy is present, but not where they are. They do
								not get a surprise round against you, or you get to act in the surprise round. You may attempt to target
								the enemy by guessing which square they are in, and may attempt knowledge checks against them at a -10
								(or -5 if someone has observed it and can relay information). Very imprecise senses (such as normal
								hearing or smell) can only raise detection up to this level, though they may also give you directional
								information.</li>
							<li style="display: none;"><i>Unnoticed</i> - (UI) While a creature is detected in some fashion, maybe
								even observed, you do not know they are an enemy. If they initiate combat, they can attempt a Bluff
								check versus Sense Motive to get a surprise round; if they fail, their detection level rises to the
								appropriate level. Disguise and social maneuvers cannot lower detection below this state.</li>
							<li style="display: none;"><i>Undetected</i> - (CRB) You have no idea a creature is even present. They are
								not valid targets for abilities, and if they initiate combat, they gain a surprise round which you do
								not act in, and you are caught off-guard. They have total concealment (50% miss chance).</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Initiative</i> - You can only roll for initiative once an enemy is detected. If
						you were distracted by an activity when initiative is rolled, you use the skill check relative to the
						activity you were doing as your initiative and act one round delayed.</li>
				</ul>
				<ul class="toggleLiVis" style="list-style-type: circle;">
					<li style="list-style-type: none;"><b>Social Maneuvers Redux</b></li>
					<li style="list-style-type: none; display: none;"><b>Social Maneuvers Redux:</b></li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Note: This is not, and does not replace or supplement, verbal duels.</i></li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>What is it?</i> - Social Maneuvers are a collection of special attacks, like
						combat maneuvers, that are done with Charisma. The DC for all Social Maneuvers is 10 + their opposed skill
						bonus (diplomacy vs diplomacy, sense motive vs bluff or intimidate). Each social skill has both fast Social
						Maneuvers which may be done during combat as a standard action, and a slower Social Maneuvers which may not
						be attempted during combat. None of these Social Maneuvers have any effect on mindless creatures.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Bluff Maneuvers</i> - These Social Maneuvers use the Bluff skill opposed by your
						opponents Sense Motive, and are often dishonorable. The maneuvers are modified by the modifiers outlined in
						bluff.
						<ul style="list-style-type: lower-greek;">
							<li style="display: none;"><i>Feint</i> - (Standard Action) You use Bluff in combat to cause your opponent
								to be denied their Dexterity bonus to AC against your next attack made before the end of the next round.
								If your opponent is not well trained in Sense Motive, use their HD + Wis modifier to determine the DC to
								feint. You take a -4 penalty when attempting to feint against a non-humanoid, and a -8 penalty when
								attempting to feint against a creature with an intelligence of 1 or 2.</li>
							<li style="display: none;"><i>Feign Harmlessness</i> - (Full-Round Action) You attempt to convince your
								enemies that you are of no threat to them. If you are at least one size category smaller than your
								target and have taken no visible offensive actions, you gain a +5 bonus on this check. Even if you have
								proven yourself capable, you can attempt to present your previous success as a one-time fluke with a -10
								penalty.</li>
							<li style="display: none;"><i>Coax</i> - (1 minute) You can attempt to coax a target into thinking that a
								suggestion of your is their own idea. This requires you first making a far-fetched bluff check, followed
								by an indifferent make request action through diplomacy, which is usually too difficult to accomplish
								during combat..</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Diplomacy Maneuvers</i> - These Social Maneuvers use the Diplomacy skill opposed
						by your opponents Diplomacy, and cannot be attempted on creatures that do not share a language with you,
						except for animals if you have the wild empathy ability. You gain a +5 bonus on these Social Maneuvers when
						attempting them against friendly creatures, and conversely take a -5 and -10 penalty respectively when
						attempting them against unfriendly or hostile creatures.
						<ul style="list-style-type: lower-greek;">
							<li style="display: none;"><i>Make Request</i> - (Standard Action) If a creature's attitude toward you is
								at least indifferent, you can make requests of them. Once a creature is helpful, they give in to most
								requests without needing a check. If the request goes against the creature's nature, its core values, or
								puts it in serious peril, however, the request may instead automatically fail subject to the GMs
								discretion, though a helpful creature may offer an alternative that honors the spirit of the request.
								See diplomacy for modifiers for requests being simple or conversely being complicated, lengthy,
								secretive, or dangerous.</li>
							<li style="display: none;"><i>Call Truce</i> - (1-Round Action) While in combat, you can call for a truce.
								When doing so, you can't be wielding a weapon or other threatening implement, and must be in plain sight
								of most of the creatures you're entreating. Once you've called for a truce, if any of your allies attack
								or take threatening actions against those you are entreating before the start of your nex turn, your
								call is unsuccessful. At the start of your next turn, you may attempt a single Diplomacy check against
								the hostile groups leader or the one with the highest bonus to diplomacy. If you are successful, combat
								ceases for 1 minute, or until any creature in the opposing group is threatened or attacked. If this
								parley would inherently result in the opponents surrendering or losing, pausing is inherently dangerous,
								or they are fighting to the death, the call automatically fails.</li>
							<li style="display: none;"><i>Influence Starting Attitude</i> - (1 minute action) You can improve the
								starting attitude of an NPC by for 1d4 hours. This is generally ineffective in combat or against
								creatures that intend to harm you or your allies in the immediate future.</li>
							<li style="display: none;"><i>Socialize</i> - (At least 10 minutes, usually 1 hour, up to 8 hours) You
								attempt to permanently improve the attitude of the target. This typically has a set DC, but a suggested
								DC is their normal diplomacy DC plus their HD. If social rounds are being used instead, see those for
								more information.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Intimidate Maneuvers</i> - These Social Maneuvers use the Intimidate skill
						opposed by your opponents Sense Motive. You get a +4 size bonus on these maneuvers if you are larger than
						your target, and a -4 penalty if you are smaller. Failed intimidate checks can usually be retried at a
						stacking -5 penalty which resets after one hour.
						<ul style="list-style-type: lower-greek;">
							<li style="display: none;"><i>Demoralize</i> - (Standard Action) You attempt to give your the shaken
								condition, though this cannot stack with other shaken conditions to make an affected creature
								frightened. If you are successful, they are shaken for 1 round, plus 1 round for every 5 by which you
								beat the DC. You can only threaten an opponent this way if they are within 30 feet and can clearly see
								and hear you. Using this ability again can extend the duration.</li>
							<li style="display: none;"><i>Challenge</i> - (Full-Round Action) You challenge your target to a duel.
								They must be within 30 feet and can clearly see and hear you. On a success, they enter a duel with you
								(following duel rules according to their honor) and cannot withdraw from the duel for 1 round + 1
								additional round for every 5 by which you beat the DC.</li>
							<li style="display: none;"><i>Cow into Submission</i> - (1 minute) You attempt to force an opponent to act
								as though they are friendly for 1d6 x 10 minutes. Whether not this is successful, the targets true
								attitude falls to no better than unfriendly, and they may report you to the authorities.</li>
							<li style="display: none;"><i>Coerce</i> - (1d4 x 10 minutes) <b>This is an Evil act!</b> You can coerce
								someone into acting as though they are friendly as though you are cowing them into submission for 1d6
								hours + 1 hour for every 5 points by which you beat the DC. If you successfully use this ability on the
								same creature at least once per week for 1d6 weeks without ever failing a check against the target, the
								duration of this coercion increases to 2d8 days with each check. The creatures true attitude becomes
								hostile, and if they believe that can take action against you that can't be traced back to them, or
								enlist aid against you, are likely to take such opportunities.</li>

					<li style="list-style-type: none; display: none;"><b>Unchained Systems:</b></li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Background Skills</i> - Approved, along with Artistry and Lore. Players may
						argue their case for using Artistry, Lore, or Profession skills in place of regular skill checks. All Lore
						choices should be discussed with the GM.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Classes</i> - Mandatory replacement for non-unchained versions. Classic Monk
						only allowed with specific archetypes that cannot be used with the unchained monk. Barbarians, Bloodgragers,
						Skalds, and archetypes granting rage may use traditional or unchained rage, but are encouraged to use
						unchained version.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Diseases and Poisons</i> - Generally use as a replacement for poisons and
						diseases in game, which helps them to scale more evenly with levels (not overpowered followed by
						irrelevant).</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Dynamic Magic Item Creation</i> - Fully implemented, replacing standard magic
						item crafting. While perks will not increase sale values, they may increase barter/trade acceptance. Quirks
						or flaws may lower value or prevent a sale at GM's discretion. Cursed items can never be sold. [GM NOTE:
						Look at perks/quirks/flaws often when selling unique merchant loot]</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Expanded Craft, Perform, and Profession Rules</i> - Approved, framework for
						manual crafting and other background skills.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Fractional BAB</i> - Mandatory</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Skill Unlocks</i> - Approved, requires signature skill feat, which can only be
						taken once (stacks with rogues ability).</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Stamina and Combat Tricks</i> - Approved, can be taken as the Combat Stamina
						Feat. Fighters get this feat for free at 1st level.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Wild Magic</i> - Implement boost casting option. Wild magic table is used for
						spells lost to concentration, arcane failure, counterspelled spells, casting in wild zones(always
						noticeable), and failed attempts at boost casting. Wild magic rolls imitating a higher-level spell than the
						expended slot, or with an inappropriate effect, defaults to the universal surge effects table instead.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Wounds</i> - Use 50% wound threshold system, add "Wounded" to status and
						deathwatch spells, and keep adjustments to disabled replacing staggered condition.</li>
				</ul>
				<ul class="toggleLiVis" style="list-style-type: circle;">
					<li style="list-style-type: none;"><b>Other Systems</b></li>
					<li style="list-style-type: none; display: none;"><b>Other Systems:</b></li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Critical Saving Throws (2e)</i> - When making a saving throw, rolling a natural
						1 or 20 have additional effects. With a nat20, the subject suffers no effects, including damage (like
						evasion) or any other effects that normally still apply on a successful saving throw, as though they were
						not targeted. With a nat1, the subject suffers double all hostile effects (damage, duration, etc.) and may
						not make subsequent saving throw attempts to end ongoing effects (like <i>hold person</i>).</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Horror Adventures (HA)</i> - Use corruptions as a replacement for default
						transformations into vampires, lycanthropes, etc.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Massive Damage (CRB)</i> - Creatures are subject to massive damage if the take
						more than 50 points of damage from a single attack which is also more than half they total hp. They must
						make a Fortitude save (DC10 + 1/10 damage taken) or immediately die.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Medicine (2e)</i> - Implement "Treat Wounds" as a heal action. Treat wounds is a
						10 minute action that cannot be performed on the same character more than once per hour or more than a
						number of times per day equal to their Con modifier (minimum 1). They may be attempted a number of times per
						day equal to the healer's ranks in the heal skill, with a DC of 15, and each attempt requires one dose from
						a healer's kit. If successful, the subject heals 1/hp/HD up to a maximum equal to their CON score. By
						Spending 1 hour and 2 charges from a healer's kit, the healer may instead attempt to "Treat Deadly Wounds"
						with a DC20 to heal double what would've been healed with "Treat Wounds." A Character may only benefit from
						"Treat Deadly Wounds" once per day. Any affect that alters how much healing is done via "Treat Deadly
						Wounds" applies half its benefits to the "Treat Wounds" action.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Occult Adventures (AO)</i> - Can be used by any player that wants to use them,
						including chakras, occult rituals, occult skill unlocks, and psychic duels.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Retraining (UC)</i> - Always available, see pdf attachment for more information.
					</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Scars (CRB)</i> - Any time a character takes enough damage in a single encounter
						to become "Wounded," they develop a minor scar - something that regular healing magic and rest doesn't heal.
						Minor scars are interesting but otherwise entirely cosmetic, though a player may wish to record them. If a
						character suffers massive damage (even if they succeed on their saving throw) they develop a major scar,
						such as a cut on the face, loss of a finger or ear, or even the loss of a limb. The GM or player should
						decide the results of a major scar or roll on the table for scars and wounds. <i>Regenerate</i> and similar
						effects heal scars.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Six-Second Rule (CRB)</i> - Except for the first player to act, if it takes you
						longer than 6 seconds to decide what you want to do in combat, you automatically delay until you are ready
						to act.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Ultimate "X"</i> - All of the ultimate systems are approved in a general scope,
						while specific ultimate campaign systems are used in a campaign-specific context, as most of those systems
						are only useable in specific styles of campaigns or edge-case scenarios.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Underwater Combat Overhaul (AA)</i> Underwater Combat was overhauled in aquatic
						adventures, clarifying drowning (and making water not an instant-kill threat), resolving movement questions,
						addressing weapon issues, and adding depth to underwater adventures and exploration.</li>

					<li style="list-style-type: none; display: none;">These are new feats, listed with their requirements (mergers
						don't count).
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Greater Hamstring</i> - (Powerful Maneuvers, BAB +6, Str 13) You receive a +2
						bonus on checks made to hamstring a foe. This bonus stacks with the bonus granted by Powerful Maneuvers.
						When you successfully hamstring an opponent using an attack of opportunity, that opponent cannot move for
						the rest of their turn.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Iron Guard</i> - (Shield Focus, Shield Proficiency, BAB +6) You gain the
						benefits of evasion while you have a heavy shield or tower shield in one hand. You are not limited to light
						or medium armor to benefit from this effect.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Savage Charge</i> - (Str 15, Spring Attack, Vital Strike, BAB +8) You can use
						Vital Strike as part of a Charge or Spring Attack.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Whirling Cleave</i> - (Str 13, Cleave, Great Cleave, Nimble, Step Up, Step Up
						and Strike, BAB +11) When using Cleave or Great Cleave, if your initial attack hits, you may take a single
						5-foot step as a free-action before making your additional attacks. If doing so places a creature within
						your threatened area, that creature becomes a legal target for your additional Cleave attack(s) as long as
						it meets all other prerequisites. If taken with Cleave Through, you may take a 5-foot step after each
						successful strike up to your maximum movement.</li>

					<li style="list-style-type: none; display: none;"><b>Feats Altered:</b></li>
					<li style="list-style-type: none; display: none;">These are changes to an existing feat's original text.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Ancestral Weapon Mastery</i> - Grants weapon proficiency and weapon focus
						simultaneously to all ancestral weapons.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Blind Fight - Also negates the attack penalties of Dazzled and Blinded.</i>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Blessed Water</i> - The number of uses is based on Charisma instead of Wisdom.
					</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Diehard</i> - (unchained) You may choose to remain conscious (and disabled)
						instead of falling unconscious due to non-lethal damage, regardless of the amount you have taken. When
						disabled for any reason, you may still take attacks of opportunity.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Dirty Fighting</i> - Reworked, loses all former benefits. Now combines benefits
						of Improved Dirty Trick, feint, and steal, and allows you to count as having a Dex of 13 and an Int of 13
						for the purpose of meeting the prerequisites of various combat maneuver feats.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Healer's Hands</i> - Adjusts the action economy of Treat Wounds to a Full-Round
						action, and Treat Deadly Wounds to a 10-minute action. This feat still increases the amount of healing via
						Treat Deadly Wounds and Treat Wounds (half the bonus to Treat Deadly Wounds), but no longer allows a
						creature to benefit from Treat Deadly Wounds more than once per day.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Improved Critical</i> - Now applies to all weapons in a single fighter weapon
						group. This bonus only applies to weapons you are proficient with.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Monkey Lunge</i> - (Errata) Activation is a swift action, not a standard action.
					</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Natural Spell</i> - Can be used with the Change Shape special quality.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Nimble Moves</i> - Now also provides the benefits of Following Step for
						creatures that also have the Step Up feat. Feats that normally require Following Step require Nimble Moves
						instead.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Precise Shot</i> - No longer requires Point-Blank Shot as a prerequisite. Feats
						that require Point-Blank Shot (except for Point-Blank Master) require Precise-Shot instead.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Prestigious Spellcaster</i> - Only requires the selected prestige class to be a
						favored class, regardless of the method.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Rapid Reload</i> - Slings and Staves can be reloaded as a free action.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Scorpion Style</i> - (Now Requires Unarmed Fighter and either Deft Maneuvers or
						Powerful Maneuvers) Reworked. Now allows the use of bull-rush (shove), drag, hamstring, overrun, reposition,
						and trip combat maneuvers against creatures up to two size categories larger. [Special]: By spending 1 ki
						point, a monk can use these maneuvers against opponents up to three sizes larger, and is treated as two
						sizes larger while grappling. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to their Wisdom modifier.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Shield Focus</i> - Also grants an additional +4 bonus to AC against ranged
						attacks.
						<br>&emsp; <i>Greater Shield Focus</i> - Shield bonus also applies against all ranged touch attacks
						(including rays). If a ranged touch attack misses because of this bonus, resolve its effects against the
						shield.
					</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Style Feats</i> - (unchained) All Style feats now also require Fighter 1 or Monk
						1 (if they didn't before). These minimum requirements increase by 3 levels for each style feat also required
						as a prerequisite.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Two-Weapon Fighting</i> - Also grants the ability to draw two weapons as part of
						a move if the wielder has a BAB of +2 or higher. Reduces the penalty of off-hand weapons for all finesse
						weapons (not just light weapons).</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Weapon Proficiency</i> - When taken as a feat, it not grants proficiency with
						all weapons in a single fighter weapon group, instead of to single weapons. This does not alter starting
						weapon proficiencies. Martial Weapon Proficiency can no longer be taken as a feat, but may still be granted
						from native class proficiencies.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Weapon Focus / Greater Weapon Focus</i> - Now grants its bonus to all weapons in
						a single fighter weapon group instead of a single weapon. This bonus only applies to weapons you are
						proficient with. <b>Hero Lab Change:</b> This does not change higher-chain feats (like weapon
						specialization).</li>

				<ul class="toggleLiVis" style="list-style-type: circle;">
					<li style="list-style-type: none;"><b>Condition Changes</b></li>
					<li style="list-style-type: none; display: none;"><b>Condition Changes:</b></li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Blinded</i> - Unified with Dazzled changes, is now a more severe form of
						Dazzled. They additionally gain a -2 penalty on attack rolls. Conversely, this condition has no effect on
						creatures with precise senses other than vision.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Confused</i> - (2E) A confused creature is off guard, doesn't treat anyone as
						their ally, cannot delay or ready an action, and cannot take immediate actions or attacks of opportunity. At
						the beginning of each turn, they roll on the confused table to see what they do (act normally, nothing,
						damage self, or attack nearest creature). If a confused creature was attacked since they last acted
						normally, and at least one of their attackers is alive and visible, they randomly attack one of their
						attackers instead of babbling incoherently, damaging themselves, or attacking the nearest creature.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Dazzled</i> - (2E) Merged with partial blindness. New Text: <i>The creature is
							unable to see clearly, often because of over stimulation. A dazzled creature takes a -1 penalty on attack
							rolls and perception checks, and all enemies gain partial concealment (20% miss chance). This has no
							effect on creatures with precise senses other than vision. </i></li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Deafened</i> - Unified with Rung changes, is now a more severe form of Rung. If
						imposed during combat, the target's current initiative falls by the listed penalty for the duration of the
						encounter. Sightless creatures reliant on sound also gain the penalties of being Blinded.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Disabled</i> - (Unchained) A creature is now disabled and not dying when they
						have between 0 hit points(hp) and negative hp up to their constitution modifier. Creatures with negative
						constitution modifiers are considered disabled before they reach 0 hp (at a positive hp equal to their
						constitution penalty), but do not take damage from performing standard actions while at positive hp.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Doomed</i> - (CoT) Descriptive Text: <i>The creatures soul has been gripped by a
							powerful force that calls them closer to death. This condition always has a value, which usually begins at
							1. The creature dies when their negative hit points equals their constitution minus their Doomed value; if
							their Doomed value becomes equal to their constitution, their are immediately slain as though via a death
							effect. Once the source of their Doom is removed, their Doomed value decreases by 1 each time they get a
							full night's rest.</i>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Exhausted</i> - Formally a heightened form of Fatigued.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Kneeling or Sitting / Prone</i> - Prone is formally a more severe form of
						kneeling or sitting. Standing from kneeling or sitting takes the same actions and has the same effects as
						standing from prone, though it may be done as part of a move. You cannot take a 5-ft. step while kneeling,
						sitting,
						or prone. Kneeling, sitting, or going prone behind partial cover will usually grant cover. A creature that
						is tripped while kneeling or sitting is knocked prone. Creatures that are immune to trip cannot kneel, sit,
						or go prone.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Nauseated</i> - Formally a more severe form of sickened.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Off-Balance</i> - (UA) Clarified difference between being off balance on land vs
						underwater. New Text: <i>This creature lacks sure footing or stability. They no longer threaten or flank
							other creatures and lose their dexterity bonus to their combat manuever defense (CMD) and skill checks.
							Spending a move action to regain their footing, moving, or taking a 5-ft. step removes this condition. If
							an off-balance creature is further knocked off-balance, they are also knocked prone. Creatures that cannot
							be tripped also cannot be knocked off balance.
							<br>This condition is more perilous for creatures that are swimming. They become off-guard, their
							piercing weapons become just as infective in water as bludgeoning weapons, and opponents gain a +2 bonus
							on attack rolls against it. This condition persists until the creature succeeds on a swim check or is no
							longer swimming. Any effect that would normally knock a swimming creature prone instead knocks them
							off-balance. </i></li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Rung</i> - Terminology for partial deafness, unified with Dazzled. If applied
						during combat, the target's current initiative falls by the listed penalty for the duration of the
						encounter. Sound based effects that impose a penalty on a failed saving throw (such as a roar that causes
						targets to become frightened) also impose this condition for the duration (or 1 round if no duration is
						listed). Effects that cause deafness on a failed saving throw that are not entirely negated by a success
						also inflict this condition on a successful save for the duration (or 1 round if no duration is listed).
						<br> Descriptive Text: <i>The creature is hard of hearing or distracted by a persistent ringing in their
							ears. They take a -2 penalty on initiative and sound-based perception checks. Sightless creatures reliant
							on sound also gain the penalties of being Dazzled.</i>
					</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i> Shaken / Frightened / Panicked / Cowering</i> - (Errata) Creatures immune to
						fear are also immune to these conditions. Cowering creatures can (and must) take the total defense action
						each turn, but can take no other actions. Cowering creatures are no longer off-guard, but still take a -2
						penalty to Armor Class. Cowering is a more extreme state of fear than panicked, and effects that heighten a
						creatures level of fear may heighten a creature from panicked to cowering, and from cowering to helpless.
					</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Stunned</i> - Formally a more severe form of Dazed.
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Unconscious</i> - (Errata) Being asleep counts as being unconscious. Creatures
						who do not sleep also cannot be unconscious.</li>
				</ul>
				<ul class="toggleLiVis" style="list-style-type: circle;">
					<li style="list-style-type: none;"><b>Magic Changes</b></li>
					<li style="list-style-type: none; display: none;"><b>Magic Changes:</b></li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Boost Casting</i> - Caters may attempt to boost-cast their spells, applying
						metamagic feats to their spells without raising the spell level, though failure may result in wild magic.
						See Wild Magic for more information.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Cure/Harm Spells</i> - (Errata) Spells that heal living and harm undead do so
						via positive energy; spells that harm living and heal undead do so via negative energy.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Heighten Metamagic</i> - Now a universal ability and the natural result of
						prepping a spell in a higher spell slot (or boost casting to a higher slot).</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Polymorph</i> - (RAI) You can never polymorph into an epic form.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Specific Spell Changes</i>
						<ul style="list-style-type: lower-greek;">
							<li style="display: none;"><i>Baleful Shadow Transmutation</i> - (Errata) Gains the polymorph descriptor.
							</li>
							<li style="display: none;"><i>Deathwatch</i> - (unchained) Shows healthy, injured, wounded (50% or less),
								fragile (wounded with 3hp or less), disabled, dying, dead, undead, or neither alive nor dead.</li>
							<li style="display: none;"><i>Magic Jar</i> - (OA) All instances of <i>Magic Jar</i> are replaced with
								<i>possession</i>.
							</li>
							<li style="display: none;"><i>Levitate</i> - (Errata) Creatures that are levitating gain the off-balance
								condition while under the effect of this spell (instead of the unstable penalty as outlined). If knocked
								prone while levitating, they instead gain the enhanced penalties of being off-balance while underwater
								until they spend a ful round action to stabilize themselves.
							<li style="display: none;"><i>Mind Blank</i> - (Errata) Only protects against divination effects which
								gather information about the creature, not all spells of the divination school.</li>
							<li style="display: none;"><i>Reincarnate</i> - (UC) Uses the expanded races reincarnation table (see
								AoN).</li>
							<li style="display: none;"><i>Status</i> - (Interpretation) Shows a health bar (with numbers) and all
								viewable conditions as icons.</li>
							<li style="display: none;"><i>Telekinesis</i> - (Errata) You cannot use the violent thrust on closely worn
								objects, as defined by the Steal combat maneuver; Grappling with <i>telekinesis</i> does not pull the
								target adjacent to you.</li>
							<li style="display: none;"><i>Teleport (and subsequent spells)</i> - (Errata) Requires "seen casually" and
								in greater detail than illustration.</li>
							<li style="display: none;"><i>Wall of Thorns</i> - (2e) Succeeding on the Strength check allows the
								creature to move as though in difficult natural terrain, as opposed to moving a distance based on the
								check.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Spells Known</i> - (2e) For casters with a limited number of spells known,
						learning a spell that has differing versions depending on the spell level (such as summon monster, cure
						wounds, or anything with a greater or lesser version) also freely adds all other versions of that spell to
						their list of spells known, once they are capable of casting them.
						<br>&emsp; - (2e) For casters with spellbooks, adding a spell to a spellbook that has differing versions
						depending on the spell level (such as summon monster, cure wounds, or anything with a greater or lesser
						version) also allows them to prep all other <i>lower-lever</i> versions of that spell from the spellbook
						without affecting the page count. This does not add the actual lower-level versions of the spell to the
						spellbook, so they cannot be copied out of the spellbook.
					</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Weapon Enhancements</i>
						<ul style="list-style-type: lower-greek;">
							<li style="display: none;"><i>Flaming & Flaming Burst</i> - (UC) Also causes the weapon to shed light like
								a torch.</li>
							<li style="display: none;"><i>Brilliant Energy</i> - (Errata) Cannot be poisoned (as they ignore
								non-living matter).</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Wild Magic</i> - Spells lost due to concentration, arcane spell failure,
						counterspell, casting in wild zones, fumbling a magic attack, or failed boost casting may result in wild
						magic. See Wild Magic for more information.</li>
				</ul>

					</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Dhampir</i> - (Errata) Fangs Alternate Racial Trait - Also gains a bite attack
						that is always a secondary natural attack that deals 1d3 damage.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Grippli</i> - Toxic Skin Alternate Racial Trait: Once per hour, this ability
						automatically and freely applies against enemies successfully grappling the Grippli as a result of the grab
						ability.</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Kobold</i> - (2e) Ability Score Modifiers changed to +2 DEX, -2 CON, +2 CHA.
						<br>&emsp; - (2e) All kobolds hatch with a scale color (players choice) that connects them to a particular
						coloration of dragon. Certain dragons, kobolds, and other creatures may react differently to them based on
						the coloration of their scales, but this choice is otherwise purely cosmetic (unless the player also chose
						the dragon-scaled alternate racial trait.)
					</li>
					<li style="display: none;"><i>Lizardfolk</i> - (Errata) Gain Survival of the Fittest trait (+1 racial bonus to
						Intimidate and Stealth checks).</li>

					<li style="list-style-type: none; display: none;"><b>Time to talk about trees:</b></li>
					<li style="display: none;">Regular Trees - Regular trees grant partial cover to creatures sharing its square,
						but doesn't
						otherwise affect the creature's fighting space.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Massive Trees - Massive trees take up an entire square and provide full cover to
						creatures
						behind them.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Fallen Trees - Fallen logs provide cover just as a low wall, and can be crossed by
						spending an additional 5 feet of movement. Massive fallen trees destroy the undergrowth and instead count as
						a high wall that is easy to climb and walk across.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Climb - Trees can be climbed (typically DC15), and a creature may choose to climb
						through connected squares of trees instead of moving along the ground, or along massive trees as though
						they were walls.</li>
				</ul>
				<ul class="toggleLiVis" style="list-style-type:circle">
					<li style="list-style-type: none;"><b>Lets talk about the forest canopy:</b></li>
					<li style="list-style-type: none; display: none;"><b>Lets talk about the forest canopy:</b></li>
					<li style="display: none;">Combat - Creatures on platforms, branches, or blinds in a forest canopy have cover
						against creatures on the ground. In medium or dense forests, or specially constructed blinds, they also have
						concealment.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Movement - Creatures can climb through the canopy as though climbing through trees,
						except that in dense forests, the canopy covers every square (unless its a clearing).</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Treehouses - Treehouse settlements are typically interconnected with platforms,
						rope bridges and ladders, and pulleys. These buildings and paths are treated as normal structures and
						terrain, though acrobatics, climb, or strength checks may be needed to traverse gaps.</li>
				</ul>
				<ul class="toggleLiVis" style="list-style-type:circle">
					<li style="list-style-type: none;"><b>What about Walking through the Undergrowth?</b></li>
					<li style="list-style-type: none; display: none;"><b>What about Walking through the Undergrowth?</b></li>
					<li style="display: none;">What is it? - Undergrowth refers to everything growing along the forest floor, from
						grasses and bushes to flowers and vines. They tend to hamper movement for creatures traversing the forest
						floor. In dense forests, undergrowth may extend all the way up to the canopy.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Light Undergrowth - These squares count as difficult terrain, provide concealment,
						and impose a -2 penalty to Acrobatics and Stealth checks.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Heavy Undergrowth - These squares count as very difficult (4x movement cost),
						provide improved concealment (30% miss chance), and impose a -5 penalty to Acrobatics checks and +3 to
						Stealth checks (+5-2).
					</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Trails - Pathways and trails wind through most forests, though they are rarer in
						dense forests. Creatures on a pathway ignore the effects of trees and undergrowth.</li>
				</ul>
				<ul class="toggleLiVis" style="list-style-type:circle">
					<li style="list-style-type: none;"><b>Shh...</b><small><i>What about Stealth and Perception?</i></small></li>
					<li style="list-style-type: none; display: none;"><b>Shh...</b><small><i>What about Stealth and
								Perception?</i></small></li>
					<li style="display: none;">Stealth - Stealth is usually easy in a forest, as the undergrowth, trees, and
						canopy can all provide cover or concealment (though they may hamper movement). Native wild creatures are
						always assumed to be using stealth while moving through forest terrain when not in combat.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Perception - The background noise of the forest increase the DC of sound-based
						perception checks by 1 per square of distance. Most forests also have a maximum visual distance where the
						foliage completely breaks line of sight.</li>

				<h3>Marsh's and Swamps</h3>
				<ul class="toggleLiVis" style="list-style-type:circle">
					<li style="list-style-type: none;"><b>What about Bogs?</b></li>
					<li style="list-style-type: none; display: none;"><b>What about Bogs></b></li>
					<li style="display: none;">What is it? - A bog is a place of deep mud or standing water more than 1 foot deep.
						Bogs and undergrowth are mutually exclusive</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Shallow Bogs - These squares count as difficult terrain, impose a -2 penalty to
						Acrobatics and Stealth, and are too shallow to swim.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Deep Bogs - These squares count as very difficult terrain (4x movement cost) for
						walking creatures, or difficult terrain for swimming creatures. These squares make acrobatics checks
						impossible and impose a -2 penalty to stealth checks. Small or smaller creatures must swim through a bog.
					</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Fighting in a Deep Bog - Small and smaller creatures gain improved cover in a deep
						bog (30% miss chance), while medium or large creatures gain cover (though they may crouch as a move action
						to gain this improved cover). Creatures with this improved cover take a -10 penalty on attacks against
						creatures without this improved cover.</li>
				</ul>
				<ul class="toggleLiVis" style="list-style-type:circle">
					<li style="list-style-type: none;"><b>What about Walking through the Undergrowth?</b></li>
					<li style="list-style-type: none; display: none;"><b>What about Walking through the Undergrowth?</b></li>
					<li style="display: none;">What is it? - Undergrowth refers to anything growing in the marsh, such as bushes,
						rushes, and grasses. They tend to hamper movement for creatures traversing the marsh.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Light Undergrowth - These squares count as difficult terrain, provide concealment,
						and impose a -2 penalty to Acrobatics and Stealth checks.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Heavy Undergrowth - These squares count as very difficult (4x movement cost),
						provide improved concealment (30% miss chance), and impose a -5 penalty to Acrobatics checks and +3 to
						Stealth checks (+5-2).
					</li>
				</ul>
				<ul class="toggleLiVis" style="list-style-type:circle">
					<li style="list-style-type: none;"><b>Quick! Tell Me about Quicksand!</b></li>
					<li style="list-style-type: none; display: none;"><b>Quick! Tell Me about Quicksand!</b></li>
					<li style="display: none;">Spotting the Danger - Quicksand is almost invisible and hard to spot. As a move
						action, a character can inspect a single square to see if it contains quicksand (typically DC15 in open
						terrain, and DC25 in dense marshes). A creature is also entitled to a DC15 Survival check to notice
						quicksand before stepping into it. Creatures that are running, charging, or moving faster than half speed in
						combat have no chance of spotting the danger before blundering into it, and their momentum typically carries
						them 5-10 feet into the quicksand before ending their movement.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Swimming - Creatures must make a swim check every round as a full-round action
						while in quicksand. It is typically DC10 to simply tread water in place, while its typically DC15 to move 5
						feet in a desired direction. Failing this check causes them to sink 5 feet into the quicksand. Otherwise,
						swimming in quicksand is the same as swimming in unusual terrain.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Rescue - Pulling out a character trapped in quicksand is difficult, and requires a
						branch, rope, or similar tool to reach the victim. Then, they must succeed at a DC15 strength check to pull
						the victim 5 feet closer, while the victim must make a DC10 strength check to hold on, or they release the
						rope and must immediately make a DC15 swim check to not sink 5 feet below the surface.</li>

				<ul class="toggleLiVis" style="list-style-type:circle">
					<li style="list-style-type: none;"><b>What about Hedgerows?</b></li>
					<li style="list-style-type: none; display: none;"><b>What about Hedgerows?</b></li>
					<li style="display: none;">What are they? - Hedgerows are tangles of stones, soil, and thorns.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Narrow Hedgerows - These function as low walls that can be moved through at the
						cost of 3 squares of movement.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Wide Hedgerows - These function as high walls that can be moved through at the cost
						of 4 squares of movement, or climbed through at the cost of 2 squares of movement.</li>

				<h3>Tell me about Buoyancy and Currents!</h3>
				<ul class="toggleLiVis" style="list-style-type:circle">
					<li style="list-style-type: none;"><b>How does Buoyancy work?</b></li>
					<li style="list-style-type: none; display: none;"><b>How does Buoyancy work?</b></li>
					<li style="display: none;">Why does it matter? Buoyancy determines how much you float or sink in the water
						when you fail (or don't attempt a needed) a swim check, whether you can walk underwater on the sea floor,
						and how easy or hard it is to swim up or down.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">What action is it to resist my buoyancy? Attempting to resist your Buoyancy is a
						free action at the start of your turn (or done as part of a move action), with the same Swim DC as
						attempting to move.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Neutral Buoyancy - If you have neutral buoyancy, you do not float or sink relative
						to where you are in the water, and you don't need to attempt a swim check to resist your buoyancy.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Rising/ Sinking - If you have rising or sinking buoyancy and fail a swim check (or
						don't resist), at the start of your turn, you are moved in the direction of your buoyancy. This movement
						knocks you off-balance and provokes attacks of opportunity. You move 10 feet on the first round, 20 feet on
						the second round, and 30 feet every round after.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Swift Buoyancy - If you have swiftly rising or sinking buoyancy, you must attempt a
						DC20 swim check at the start of your turn, or you are moved in the direction of your buoyancy 30 feet. This
						movement knocks you off-balance and provokes attacks of opportunity. If swiftly rising and already at the
						surface, you are not off-balance and may choose to stay at the surface without making any swim checks. If
						swiftly sinking and on a stable surface, you are not off-balance and may choose to stand on the bottom or
						move normally as though in difficult terrain.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Changing Buoyancy - If your buoyancy changes while being moved by your buoyancy,
						your buoyancy speed changes at a rate of 10 feet per round. If your buoyancy changes to swiftly
						rising/sinking, your buoyancy speed changes immediately.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Moving vs Buoyancy - If moving against your buoyancy (and its not neutral), you are
						treated as though you are moving through difficult terrain and your speed is halved (like going upstairs).
						If moving with your buoyancy, you may choose to move your buoyancy speed at the start of your turn
						(provoking normally) before attempting your swim check to move, effectively adding your buoyancy to your
						total movement.</li>
				</ul>
				<ul class="toggleLiVis" style="list-style-type:circle">
					<li style="list-style-type: none;"><b>What is my Natural Buoyancy?</b></li>
					<li style="list-style-type: none; display: none;"><b>What is my Natural Buoyancy?</b></li>
					<li style="display: none;">Water Subtype - If you have the water subtype, your buoyancy is always neutral
						(even if affected by magic or items).</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Aquatic Subtype - If you have the aquatic subtype, you may change your buoyancy to
						neutral as a free action at the start of your turn (unless your buoyancy is swiftly rising/ sinking). If
						your buoyancy is already neutral, you may change it to rising or sinking as a move action.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Air Subtype - If you have the air subtype, your buoyancy is swiftly rising if your
						in a light load, rising if your in a medium load, and sinking if your in a heavy load.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Air Breathers - If you are a creature that needs to breath (like humanoids), your
						buoyancy is sinking if in a light, and swiftly sinking if in a medium or heavy load or wearing heavy armor.
					</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Non Breathers - If you are a creature that does not need to breath (like
						constructs), your buoyancy is sinking if in a light load, and swiftly sinking if in a medium or heavy load
						or wearing medium or heavy armor.</li>
				</ul>
				<ul class="toggleLiVis" style="list-style-type:circle">

					<li style="list-style-type: none; display: none;"><b>What can change my Buoyancy?</b></li>
					<li style="display: none;">Water Subtype - nothing. The only way for a creature with the water subtype to not
						have neutral buoyancy is for it to change its subtype (such as via a polymorph effect)</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Aquatic Subtype - If you are not swiftly rising/ sinking, you can adjust your
						buoyancy to neutral at the start of your turn as a free action. If your buoyancy is neutral at the start of
						your turn, you may change it to rising or sinking as a move action.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Magic - Certain spells and abilities (like <i>aquakinesis</i> or <i>extreme
							buoyancy</i>) can change a creatures buoyancy.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Equipment - Certain items can be sued to adjust your buoyancy, such as air tanks
						and lead anchors. The magnitude of their effect depends on your Natural Buoyancy.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Load - Picking up or dropping items to change your load can adjust your buoyancy.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<ul class="toggleLiVis" style="list-style-type:circle">
					<li style="list-style-type: none;"><b>How is this different from currents?</b></li>
					<li style="list-style-type: none; display: none;"><b>How is this different from currents?</b></li>
					<li style="display: none;">Why does it matter? Like Buoyancy, a current can move you in the water. However, a
						current is an outside force and may move you in any direction.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Moving Water - Any water with a current at any speed is considered moving water.
						Even the ocean is considered still water in absence of a current. A current moves a person 5 feet per round
						for every 2 mph.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Resist Currents - Just like Buoyancy, you can resist the current as the same free
						action as resisting your buoyancy at the start of your turn, or as part of a move (typical DC 10-20).</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Swept Away - If you fail (or choose not) to resist the current, you are moved by
						the current in the currents direction according to its speed. Unlike Buoyancy, this does not speed up or
						slow down. This movement knocks you off-balance and provokes attacks of opportunity from creatures not being
						swept away.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Moving vs Currents - Moving against the current counts as difficult terrain and
						your speed is halved (like going upstairs). If moving with the current, you may choose to be swept away at
						the start of your turn (provoking normally) before attempting your swim check to move, effectively adding
						the currents speed to your total movement.</li>

					<li style="list-style-type: none;"><b>...fighting at the surface?</b></li>
					<li style="list-style-type: none; display: none;"><b>...fighting at the surface?</b></li>
					<li style="display: none;">Surface Tension - Surface tension is real in pathfinder, which dictates how
						attacks, spells, and extradimensional spaces function underwater. Any time the two parties fighting each
						other are fighting through surface tension (such as one party being on land while the other is underwater,
						or the parties being separated by oil etc.), these rules apply.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Total Cover - Creatures completely separated by surface tension have total cover
						from one another's attacks (including spells).</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Partial Cover - Creatures not completely separated by surface tension, but more
						than half of them is (such as submerged chest-deep in water) gain improved cover. Creatures less than half
						separated but still separated gain regular cover (such as wading through waist-high water). Creatures still
						mildly separated gain partial cover (such as walking through water just deep enough to still be difficult
						terrain, but not stepping in a puddle).</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Exception to Cover - Creatures that are both in the same body of liquid at one end
						of the surface tension, or who are both disrupting the same surface tension (such as both wading through the
						same water) do not have cover from each other. Spellcasters must choose which side of the surface tension
						(such as above or below the water line) is affected by their spell, it still cannot penetrate surface
						tension.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Piercing Weapons - Attacks that deal piercing damage can ignore the cover benefit
						provided by surface tension, but they take a -2 penalty on attack rolls to do so.</li>
				</ul>
				<ul class="toggleLiVis" style="list-style-type:circle">
					<li style="list-style-type: none;"><b>...concealment and detection?</b></li>
					<li style="list-style-type: none; display: none;"><b>...concealment and detection?</b></li>
					<li style="display: none;">Maximum Visibility - In clear water, maximum visibility is typically 4d8x10 feet
						(40 - 320). In murky water, maximum visibility is typically 1d8x10 feet (10 - 80). In open water, it is
						difficult to gain cover or concealment for stealth without swimming away from your target at least the
						distance of maximum visibility.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Visual Perception - All visual perception checks are made at a -2 in clear water,
						and between -2 and -8 in murky water (all flowing water is at least somewhat murky). In addition, creatures
						without the amphibious special quality, aquatic subtype, or water subtype take a -4 on visual perception
						checks and risk eye injury if they are not wearing some form of protective goggles.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Audible perception - While sound travels farther and faster underwater, the
						benefits are usually mitigated by ambient noise. In situations with particularly little ambient noise (such
						as no wildlife or in a sealed tank), audible perception checks gain a +2.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Scent - Creatures with keen scent, like sharks, can track blood trails from up to a
						mile away, making it easier to track wounded targets underwater. Regular scent works normally underwater ofr
						aquatic creatures, but is more tuned for detecting things at long distance. Land-based creatures typically
						cannot use scent underwater.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Tremorsense - Aquatic tremorsense detects disturbances in the water and functions
						as long as both creatures are touching the same body of water. Regular tremorsense works normally so long as
						both creatures are touching the same solid surface.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Tracking - Without keen scent, it is nearly impossible to track creatures
						underwater unless they are moving along the bottom or through something that leaves signs (like a coral
						reef). Even in such exceptional circumstances, water quickly washes away signs of passage, increasing the DC
						to track in such situations by 1 for every 10 minutes in an area without a current, and by 1 for every
						minute in an area with a current.</li>
				</ul>
				<ul class="toggleLiVis" style="list-style-type:circle">
					<li style="list-style-type: none;"><b>...temperature?</b></li>
					<li style="list-style-type: none; display: none;"><b>...temperature?</b></li>
					<li style="display: none;">Why does it matter? Immersion in water causes hypothermia more easily, and have a
						different temperature range from the surface for what is considered cold.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Temperature range - 80* and above are generally considered safe. 60*-80* is the
						same as cold weather, and a creature must pass a fortitude save each hour or take 1d6 points of nonlethal
						cold damage. 40*-60* is treated as severe cold, requiring a save every 10 minutes or dealing 1d6 nonlethal
						cold damage. 32*-40* is extreme cold and deals 1d6 lethal cold damage each minute. Liquid water below 32*
						deals 2d6 cold damage per minute.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Overheating - Heat dangers are rare in the water except in the presence of
						hydrothermal vents, as even the most extreme temperatures tend to cap around 104*.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Protection - <i>Endure elements</i> protects its target from water as cold as 32*
						(as opposed to -50* in air), which is usually enough protection. Sea creatures are generally adapted to the
						water temperature of their habitat.</li>

				<ul class="toggleLiVis" style="list-style-type:circle">
					<li style="list-style-type: none;"><b>...dealing with pressure?</b></li>
					<li style="list-style-type: none; display: none;"><b>...dealing with pressure?</b></li>
					<li style="display: none;">Air, Aquatic, and Water Subtype - Creatures with the air subtype can adapt to
						pressure normally, but they treat the surface as their native zone, adapting to pressure all at once when
						returning to the surface from underwater. Creatures with the aquatic subtype are native to one oceanic zone
						(for most aquatic creatures, especially ones can also walk on the surface, that is usually the sunlight
						zone). Creatures with the water subtype are always considered native to all oceanic zones and cannot take
						damage from pressure.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Surface Dwellers - Creatures not native to underwater environments treat the 0-100
						feet underwater as their native pressure range.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Outside Native Zone - Creatures outside of their native zone must succeed at a
						fortitude (DC15 + 1 per minute after the first) save every minute or take 1d6 points of damage, plus 1d6
						points of damage for every 100 feet beyond the first. Example: Dave the land dweller (native range 0-100
						feet) is 220 feet below the surface, and has been below his native zone for 3 rounds. This round, he must
						make a DC18 Fortitude save or take 2d6 damage</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Adapting to Pressure - Creatures outside their native zone adapt to pressure after
						making 5 fortitude saves (does not need to be consecutive), at which point their native zone shifts by 100
						feet. Example: Dave the land dweller (native range 0-100) is 220 feet below the surface. After making 5
						Fortitude saves, his adapted native range is 100-200 feet. After making 5 more saves, his adapted native
						range is 200-300 feet an he no longer needs to attempt fortitude saves, though he will experience pressure
						hazards when he ascends back to the surface.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Teleportation - Creatures instantly transported to a depth outside their native
						zone immediately being making saves as normal and may be in danger is the discrepancy in depth is vast.
						Aquatic creatures instantly transported back to their native zone after being adapting to being outside it
						take damage and make saves normally, but adapt completely to their native zone after making 5 fortitude
						saves.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Dealing with Pressure - The easiest and safest way to deal with pressure is to
						adjust depths gradually. Alternatively, spells like <i>freedom of movement</i>, <i>life bubble</i>, and
						<i>pressure adaptation</i> can prevent or overcome pressure damage.
					</li>

					<li style="list-style-type: none;"><b>...equipment?</b></li>
					<li style="list-style-type: none; display: none;"><b>...equipment?</b></li>
					<li style="display: none;">Environment - Salt water is incredibly harsh, and few materials can remain
						submerged for long without disintegrating or corroding. Leather, paper, wood, and textiles disintegrate
						quickly underwater and become worse than useless, often hampering movement, while metals rust and corrode
						away. A great deal of sensitive equipment also becomes permanently destroyed underwater, as the pressure
						breaks through formerly sealed environments and particles and detritus sabotage working parts.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Other Mundane - Unprotected items (or magical items that have been submerged for a
						long time) vulnerable to salt water take 1d6 points of damage from the salt water every day which bypasses
						hardness. If the item had the fragile quality or a hardness of 0, it is always destroyed. Sensitive
						equipment (such as a compass) and items with the fragile quality is similarly destroyed if it takes any
						damage from pressure. Items submerged for 1 hour or longer underwater that isn't subsequently cleaned that
						day (such as washed if its clothing) take damage as if it was submerged for 1 day.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Magic - Most magical equipment is protected from basic water exposure and can
						usually weather prolonged exposure to salt water. As a general rule, Magical equipment can survive at least
						1 day per 100gp in value before needing to make fortitude saves, and each DC10 fortitude save protects the
						item for one additional week. Magic that protects the caster from the effects of water (such as <i>endure
							elements</i>) also protect their gear. Items with a +3 enhancement or with any energy resistance or endure
						elements property are completely immune to salt water. Metals immune to rust are likewise immune to salt
						water. Items protected from time (such as via an <i>ungent of timelessness</i>) are affected by water much
						more slowly.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Special Materials - Most alchemically treated items have the same protection as
						magic items underwater. Adamantine (and other skymetals), Blackwood, Crystal, Darkwood, Dragonhide (if the
						dragon had a swim speed), Eel Hide, Elysian Bronze, Mithral, Spiresteel, Throneglass<!--AKA Glassteel-->,
						and Voidglass are immune to the effects of salt water. Salt water is lethal to Greenwood and Living Steel,
						and any amount of damage from salt water destroys the materials ability to heal.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Primitive Materials - Many materials used underwater are considered primitive or
						useless above water. Bone, Coral, Obsidian, Shell, and Stone are protected from the effects of salt water,
						while Gold, Platinum, Silver, and other precious metals are non-corrosive and may serve a
						more-than-decorative purpose. In depths of 200+ feet, water pressure helps to hold these items together, and
						they lose the fragile quality (if they had it).</li>

					<li style="list-style-type: none;"><b>What are Oceanic Zones?</b></li>
					<li style="list-style-type: none; display: none;"><b>What are Oceanic Zones?</b></li>
					<li style="display: none;">General Info - Oceanic Zones describe the typical conditions of a specific depth,
						and oceanic life has typically adapted to one or more of these zone. Most surface dwelling creatures are not
						adapted to any of these zones.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Sunlight Zone - Depth: 0 - 660 feet. All aquatic plants that require light for
						photosynthesis exist here and is home to most marine mammals, aquatic humanoids, and fish familiar to most
						fisher-folk. Temperatures here are based on surface conditions (from 100*-30* typically). This zone has
						enough light to see with normal vision during the day.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Twilight Zone - Depth: 660 - 3,300 feet. With roughly 1% of light reaching this
						zone, there is not enough light for photosynthesis, and creatures typically feed on falling detritus.
						Despite this, roughly 90% of Golarion's fish live in this zone. Creatures with low-light vision can see to a
						distance of around 60 feet and treat the area as dim light. Many creatures in this zone rely on darkvision
						or other precise senses, while others are bioluminescent. The temperatures in this zone range from about 68*
						at the top to around 39* at the bottom with very few variations.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Midnight Zone - Depth: 3,300 - 13,000 feet. This zone has no light whatsoever from
						the surface, forcing creatures to use darkvision or on visual senses if it doesn't have its own light
						source, though light sources tend to attract predators. The creatures of this depth are the least understood
						and have the largest variety, though its hard for fish to live here, being forced to scavenge on sparse
						amounts of falling detritus. The temperature is usually 39* throughout, and the zone typically extends to
						the sea floor, with the average ocean depth being two miles.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Abyssal Zone - Depth 13,000 - 20,000 feet. This rare zone is devoid of even falling
						detritus, preventing event simple organisms from growing or forming on the seafloor at these depths except
						around hydrothermal vents. Nearly empty and devoid of life, only a few leviathans, giant squid, and
						tentacled horrors thrive in this zone, typically resting here and hunting in higher zones when they need to
						feed. The temperature is a consistent 35* - 39*.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Abaddonian Zone - Depth 20,000+ feet. Some scholars, particularly among deep sea
						races, theorize of this zones existence in the deepest ocean trenches. With pressures over 1,000 times that
						of the surface, combines with low temperatures and ambient magic, these trenches could house nightmarish
						tableau's that hardly seem possible on the Material Plane. While some scholars have funded expeditions to
						the Abaddonian zone, very few have survived a trip towards its depths, and none have returned sane enough to
						give any accounting or what they found or if they even reached its depths.</li>

					<li style="list-style-type: none; display: none;"><b>How does water normally affect different weapons?</b>
					</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Piercing - Piercing weapons typically function normally underwater, though they
						take a -2 on attack rolls if the wielder is off-balance or breaching surface tension. They also only deal
						half damage if the wielder is off-balance.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Bludgeoning or Slashing - Weapons that deal bludgeoning or slashing damage
						typically take a -2 on attack rolls, deal half damage, and cannot breach surface tension.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Thrown Weapons - Thrown weapons take a -2 penalty on attack rolls for every 5 feet
						of water, and are typically too inaccurate to be effective unless thrown from directly above the target and
						using its buoyancy to reach it. Piercing weapons (such as spears) can be thrown from above the water in this
						manner taking the additional -2 on attack rolls for breaching surface tension.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Ranged Weapons - Ranged weapons not designed to be used underwater take a -2
						penalty on attack rolls for every 5 feet of water. Underwater ranged weapons are designed to overcome this
						penalty, but typically have a reduced range. Piercing weapons (such as harpoons) can be fired from above the
						water at its target, taking the additional -2 on attack rolls for breaching surface tension.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Combat Maneuvers - Most combat maneuvers work normally underwater, but creatures
						without a swim speed take a -2 penalty on grapple combat maneuvers. Damage dealt via grapple and via attacks
						with the grab special ability deal full damage underwater, even if the damage is bludgeoning or piercing.

					<li style="list-style-type: none; display: none;"><b>How do you cast magic underwater?</b></li>
					<li style="display: none;">Holding Breath - Any time a creature is holding its breath (such as being
						underwater) and attempts to cast a spell, they must succeed at a concentration check (DC 15 + spell level)
						to cast a spell at all, even if it has no verbal components.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Verbal Components - Every spell/ability with a verbal component reduces your
						remaining breath by 3 rounds (must have at least 3 rounds left), or by 1 round if it has a casting time of
						swift or immediate (must have at least 1 round).</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Spell Components - Mundane spell components generally work fine underwater, and
						aquatic-appropriate substitutions exist for any mundane component that would be inherently impossible to use
						underwater.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Surface Tension - Spells cannot typically break surface tension, and creatures
						completely separated from you via surface tension have total cover from your spells.</li>

					<li style="display: none;">What is it? Off-balance is a special state (not technically a condition) that
						provides a few combat adjustments.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">What does it adjust? A creature off-balance is treated as off-guard, its piercing
						weapons become as ineffective in water as bludgeoning weapons, and its opponents gains a +2 on attack rolls
						against it.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">How does it happen? Generally, any time a creature fails a swim check or allows
						itself to be dragged by a current or its buoyancy, it becomes knocked off-balance. It can also be inflicted
						on a creature who would normally be knocked prone, such as via a trip, bull-rush, or overrun combat
						maneuver.</li>

					</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Swim Speed - Having a swim speed overcomes a lot of the penalties of being

				<h3>I have an edge-case question about a specific thing...</h3>
				<ul class="toggleLiVis" style="list-style-type:circle">
					<li style="list-style-type: none;"><b>Using Potions Underwater</b></li>
					<li style="list-style-type: none; display: none;"><b>Using Potions Underwater:</b></li>
					<li style="display: none;">Potions and extracts cannot normally be used underwater due to surface tension -
						It's not as much that the water dilutes the potion as much as the potion can't come out without air going
						in.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Potion Sponges are cheap and easy items that allow you to consume potions and
						extracts underwater. Also, any spell that creates a safe and breathable environment (like <i>life
							bubble</i>) allows you to drink potions underwater.</li>
				</ul>
				<ul class="toggleLiVis" style="list-style-type:circle">
					<li style="list-style-type: none;"><b>Extradimensional Spaces</b></li>
					<li style="list-style-type: none; display: none;"><b>Extradimensional Spaces:</b></li>
					<li style="display: none;">Newly conjured extradimensional spaces use the surrounding environment for their
						atmosphere, so casting <i>rope trick</i> would create an extradimensional space filled with water if cast
						underwater. The exception to this are spells which also create an environment (like <i>Mage's Magnificent
							Mansion</i>).</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Due to surface tension, if the entryway of an existing extradimensional space moves
						to a new location, it retains its original atmosphere (if it had air, it still has air that can't be let
						out, if it had water it still has water that can't be let out).</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Extradimensional containers (like a bag of holding) are designed to maintain
						surface tension and only allow attended objects in and out (otherwise, they would rupture quickly after
						being overloaded). As such, a bag of holding remains filled with air underwater (unless a caster enters it
						and fills it with conjured water). However, if the container cannot replenish its fresh air/water supply in
						its new location, the air/water inside is considered stagnant and is not breathable.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Items removed from an extradimensional container while underwater are usually
						soaked through immediately. Should items be placed inside the container while underwater, enough water is
						able to breach the surface tension with the item to the generally get everything inside the bag wet, though
						not enough to weigh down the container. Wet items added to a bag above water tend to make many of the bags
						contents moist over time in the sealed environment. For this reason, it is often wise to keep certain items
						(like spellbooks) in a waterproof bag inside extradimensional containers if underwater adventuring is
						expected.</li>

				<ul class="toggleLiVis" style="list-style-type:circle">
					<li style="list-style-type: none;"><b><i>Freedom of Movement</i></b></li>
					<li style="list-style-type: none; display: none;"><b><i>Freedom of Movement</i>:</b></li>
					<li style="display: none;">Benefits and Limitations - This spell negates most of the penalties of being
						underwater, including dealing with pressure, making swim checks, dealing with difficult terrain (such as
						moving against a current), damaging equipment, and attack and damage penalties (such as using a slashing
						weapon). It does not, however, grant the ability to breathe underwater.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Normal Movement - <i>Freedom of Movement</i> allows a creature to move normally in
						their given environment. As creatures cannot walk in water, their land speed would still be 1/4 normal as
						they swim, they simply do not need to make checks, as it does not allow creatures to pretend water is solid
						enough to walk on (above or under water). It does allow a creature to walk along a stable surface (like the
						seafloor) underwater at full speed.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Other Forms of Movement - This spell enables creatures to travel at full speed with
						flight as though in air or with burrow as though underground. This spell does not allow creatures with
						abilities like earth glide to pretend that water is earth. It also does not allow creatures with a climb
						speed to pretend there are things they can climb against, just as it does not allow creatures to pretend
						there are things to walk on.</li>

					<li style="display: none;"><i>Breath of Life</i> may be used to rescue a drowning or drowned character, even
						underwater. In the event a creature drowned, they are treated as though they had taken damage equal to the
						amount required to slay them for the purposes of this spell.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">If a drowning creature is not healed enough to render them conscious and they still
						cannot breathe, they continue drowning normally. If a drowned creature is not healed enough to render them
						conscious and they still cannot breathe, they return to Step 2 of drowning, take 1 point of damage, and
						drown at the beginning of their turn.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">If a drowning or drowned creature is healed enough to become conscious and they
						still cannot breathe, they must immediately make a Con check at their previous DC + 1. If they fail, they
						resume drowning normally at Step 1.</li>

					<li style="list-style-type: none; display: none;"><b><i>Off-Balance Special Circumstance</i>:</b></li>
					<li style="display: none;">Causes - Failing a swim check, getting "knocked prone" while underwater or
						levitating or while riding or flying without being knocked to the ground or while "swimming" on land, or
						allowing yourself to be moved by someone or something else in a way that provokes attacks of opportunity
						while flying, riding, or swimming.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Penalties - You become off-guard, you take a -2 on attack rolls, and enemies gain
						a +2 on attack rolls against you.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Resolution - You spend a move action to right yourself. This requires a swim check
						if underwater, a ride check if mounted, a fly check is in the air, or an acrobatics check (DC10, creatures
						with a land speed can take a 10) if on land.</li>

					<li style="list-style-type: none; display: none;"><b><i>Swimming in Unusual Terrain</i>:</b></li>
					<li style="display: none;">Water-like Terrain - This terrain include things that aren't water but are mostly
						water, such as: alcohol, bogs, dirty water, urine, or other viscous materials. Swimming in this terrain type
						uses the same rules as regular water, but water breathing creatures are exposed to anything in the water
						(like poisons) as if it was both ingested and inhaled, rolling against the higher DC (if varied). Creatures
						with the amphibious subtype gain a +4 bonus on fortitude saves against these effects.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Unusual Terrain - This terrain include things that aren't mostly water but could be
						swum through, such as: bile, flotsam, oil, quicksand, mucus, mud, slime, slush, and tar. Swimming in this
						terrain types is treated as difficult terrain, creatures with a swim speed cannot take a 10 in these
						environment, and such creatures only gain half the bonus of their swim speed on swim checks (+4 instead of
						+8). Creatures that can breathe water can still suffocate, but it takes twice as long.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Dangerous Terrain - This terrain includes anything that is naturally hazardous but
						could be (theoretically) swum through, such as: acid, burning oil or tar, crushing detritus, freezing
						icewater, or lava. Swimming in this terrain type is treated as difficult terrain, creatures with a swim
						speed cannot take a 10 and lose their, and such creatures do not gain the bonus of their swim speed on swim
						checks (+0 instead of +8). Many of these terrains are more readily navigated via other means.</li>
					<li style="display: none;">Non-liquid-fluids - It is not normally possible to swim through these types of
						terrain, such as air, foam, steam, etc. However, when it is possible to swim through these terrains, it is
						treated as difficult terrain.</li>
