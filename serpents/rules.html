          &nbsp;“When foreigners think of Hell, they think of jagged stone and lakes of fire. But they’re wrong. A sharp rock is a blessing when the other option is quicksand and tangled mangrove roots that try to suck you down beneath the brown sludge. Fire is a blessing when the air is so wet that you drown standing up, its hot soup draining into your lungs with the funk of a thousand rotting plants. Give me the clean kiss of a devil’s lash over the festering rot that eats your toes and eyes, or the flies that burrow through your skin and lay their maggots in your flesh.
          <br>&nbsp;"No, Hell is a jungle, and those who forget it once won’t live to do so again."

    <section>
      <h3>Rules for Playing at the Table - Required to Read at Least Once</h3>
      <ul style="list-style-type: circle;"><b>Banned - Violations Will Get You Kicked Out</b>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Alcohol</i> - No alcohol in or around the house. No showing up drunk.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Smoking</i> - No smoking or vaping in or around the house. If you smoke before the game, you must change clothes and shower.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul style="list-style-type: circle;"><b>IRL Table Rules</b>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Late</i> - If you know your running late, please bring food for the table or drinks for the drink fridge.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Rolling Dice</i> - Dice need to be rolled on the table (or through an app) in plain view. If a player's dice fall off the table, they may call "Jumanji" before looking at it to take the result of the roll. Otherwise, they must re-roll.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Snack Table</i> - A snack table and drink fridge are provided with caution - anything on the table or in the fridge is fair game.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Swearing</i> - Do your best to avoid swearing (we know its hard sometimes).</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Taking Breaks</i> - Try to take breaks every hour or so (stretch, pee, grab snacks, etc.)</li>
      </ul>
      <ul style="list-style-type: circle;"><b>In-Game Table Rules</b>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Any Last Words?</i> - Players (and optionally NPCs) get a chance to say any "last words" as a death monologue when they die if they move from conscious to dead in a single turn, with a word limit equal to their constitution score. They may also choose to say their "last words" when knocked unconcious but not immediately killed, though they are not obligated to do so.
          <br>&emsp; - Mindless undead may be found repeating their last words.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Arachnophobia Mod</i> - Spiders in game will usually be referred to as bears, though they keep all their base form stats (webs, poison, climbing, etc), and pictures will be subbed for pictures of bears. If your confused about what kind of bear the GM is describing, you can ask. Otherwise, be on the look out for bears of diminutive -> gigantic size with webs.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Circumstantial RP</i> - Players may occasionally gain a +2 circumstance bonus to their roll for good RP, with new players receiving this bonus more often.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Companions</i> - Animal Companions, Cohorts, Familiars, and Mounts that are not placed on the board at the beginning of combat cannot die or take actions.
          <br>&emsp; - The above companions act on your initiative. They only use their own initiative if they are in a separate combat from you.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Critical Kills</i> - Players get to describe how their character kills an enemy that they kill with a critical hit.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Deific Bargains</i> - Players may attempt to bargain with deities at their altars. While good deities often just grant their boons freely, neutral and evil deities will often require something in exchange, with evil deities known for twisting the request.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Experience Pool</i> - Experience points are given to the party in the form of a shared pool, which may be used to push individual characters higher. No player may be more than 1 level ahead of the rest of the party.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>First Session Re-spec</i> - After your first session with any character (between games), you may re-spec choices/aspects that you feel aren't working.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Golden Hare</i> - Players with a portion of their backstory that is "too dark to explain" are haunted by an immortal glowing golden bunny until they complete their backstory.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Hex Maps</i> - This table uses hexes to measure distances, where 1 hex always equals 5ft. and the radius of effects are determined linearly. Concealment and Cover are determined via imaginary lines from the center of the origin to the center of the target, and attacks must be exactly opposite each other relative to the target for flanking. For more information on hexes, consult the core rulebook (CRB).</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Late Arrival</i> - If you walk into a session late, you do not get an update on what's happened from the GM save for a single perception check. You may then ask in-character for more information from the other players.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Life Flashes before their Eyes</i> - The first time in an encounter a creature becomes disabled (or worse) their life "flashes before their eyes" just before they take damage. When this happens, they get flashbacks of what brought them here, which may serve as a catalytic event if one is pending. Players are encouraged to recount some of their character's backstory.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>New Characters</i> - If your old character dies or retires, your new character comes in at Average Party Level (APL) - 1.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Implemented Variant Rule Systems</h3>
      <ul style="list-style-type: circle;"><b>Combat Maneuvers Rework</b>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>What is This?</i> - Combat Maneuvers have been tweaked and their rules have been unified here from multiple sources (DPG, CRB, EitR) for simplicity. Combat Maneuvers now fall into the following major categories: Deft Maneuvers, Fighting Dirty, Grappling, and Powerful Maneuvers. In each case, the Improved Combat Maneuver feat for each category merges and replaces the former individual Improved Combat Manuever feats, but all Greater Combat Manuever feats must be taken for each maneuver individually.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Charging</i> - Unchanged, but clarified: You must move at least 10ft. to charge; You may charge by flying down, falling, or swinging from a rope or vine, but to do so you must move at least 20ft. and you must have started at a higher elevation. You may not (normally) charge through difficult terrain or another creatures square, and must end in the closest square in range of the target from your point of origin, in a straight line. You may substitute a powerful maneuver for an attack on a charge. You may only do a partial charge when limited to a standard action or as a readied action.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Deft Maneuvers</i> - A Deft Maneuver is any maneuver you perform with a weapon, namely Disarm, Drag, Reposition, Sunder, and Trip. You need the Deft Maneuvers feat to perform any deft maneuver without provoking an attack of opportunity. You may substitute any attack for a deft maneuver as part of a full attack or attack of opportunity, using your BAB for that attack as your BAB on that maneuver. You may add any enhancement bonuses from your weapon to your deft maneuvers, and conversely you take a -4 penalty on your check if attempting one without using a weapon. If you attempt a deft maneuver with a finesse weapon, you may use your DEX instead of STR for your CMB. The disarm and sunder special weapon qualities provide a +2 bonus to those specific maneuvers, while if you fail either of those checks by 10 or more, you drop your weapon. You are also knocked prone if you fail a drag, reposition, or trip, attempt by 10 or more unless the weapon possess the deft (trip) quality, which allows the wielder to drop the weapon instead.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Fighting Dirty</i> - Dirty Trick and Steal combat maneuvers, along with the Feint social maneuver are all unique standard actions that are considered fighting dirty. Fighting dirty is not evil but is considered dishonorable. The Dirty Fighting feat is required to perform a Dirty Trick or Steal combat maneuver without provoking an attack of opportunity, as well as allowing you to Feint as a move action.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Grappling</i> - Grappling is an advanced combat maneuver you may attempt as a standard action or in place of an attack of opportunity. You need improved unarmed strike to initiate a grapple without provoking an attack of opportunity. You take a -4 penalty on grapple checks if you’re holding a weapon. If you are grappled, you may attempt to break or reverse the grapple as a grapple combat maneuver, escape the grapple the grapple as an escape artist check, attempt to cast a spell with no somatic components, or attack with a one handed or finesse weapon. If you wish to maintain a grapple you control, you must first attempt the grapple with a +5; if you succeed, you may choose from a list of effects to apply to the target. An outsider may “dog pile” a grappled target, giving the grappler a +2 bonus to their CMB and CMD as though aided until the grapple is released. An outsider may also attempt to wrench a grappled target free by attempting a grapple check against the controllers CMD +5; if they succeed, the grapple ends.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Power Maneuvers</i> - Powerful Maneuvers are all standard actions which may be done as part of a charge or attack of opportunity, which include the Hamstring, Overrun, and Shove (Bull Rush) combat maneuvers. You can only perform any of these maneuvers against an opponent who is no more that one size category larger than you. You need the Powerful Maneuvers feat to perform one of these maneuvers without provoking an attack of opportunity from your target. If you fail any powerful maneuver by 5 or more, you are knocked prone.
          <ul style="list-style-type: lower-greek;">
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Hamstring</i> - (Unified Feats as New Combat Maneuver) You attempt to hamstring your opponent’s movement. If your attack exceeds the target’s CMD, the target is entangled for 1 round. For every 5 by which your attack exceeds your opponent’s CMD, the penalty lasts 1 additional round. Creatures that are immune to critical hits cannot be hamstrung. Flying creatures can be hamstrung, but only if they use non-magical means of flight. </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul style="list-style-type: circle;"><b>Elephant in the Room (EitR)</b>
        <li style="display: none;"><i><a href="https://meliogeny.net/square-world/">Hero Lab Instal Link</a></i></li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Class, Combat, and Equipment Rework</i> - Approved. Classes that grant abilities/proficiency with a specific weapon still only grant benefits to that specific weapon. Nonlethal damage may be dealt without penalty from lethal weapons, but not vice-versa.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Combat Stance</i> - Before making attacks, you must determine your combat stance; you can only use one combat stance per turn. Universally, the Accurate (default) and Total Defense stances can be used by any creature, while the Power and Defensive stances can be used by any creature with a BAB of +1 or higher. Combat stances are separate from combat styles and may be used in conjunction. Feats and abilities that modify the replaced feats apply to the new stances.
          <ul style="list-style-type: lower-greek;">
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Accurate Stance</i> - (Default stance) Has no changes to AC, ATK, or DMG.</li>
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Defensive Stance</i> - (Replaces Combat Expertise and Fighting Defensively) You trade a -1 penalty to ATK for a +1 dodge bonus to AC. At BAB +4 and every four thereafter, you increase the penalty and bonus of each by 1.</li>
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Power Stance</i> - (Replaces Deadly Aim, Power Attack, and Piranha Strike) You trade a -1 penalty to ATK for a +2 bonus to DMG. At BAB +4 and every four thereafter, you increase the penalty by 1 and the bonus by 2. This bonus is multiplied alongside the strength bonus to weapon damage for the weapon being held in one or two hands, if that multiplier applies.</li>
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Total Defense</i> - (Adjusted) Declaring Total Defense is a standard action, which prevents you from making attacks of any kind until your next turn. This grants a +4 dodge bonus to AC (increases to +6 with 3+ ranks in acrobatics) and you do not provoke attacks of opportunity for any actions taken in your starting square or for leaving that square, though any further movements may provoke normally.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Feat Adjustments and Changes</i> - Approved with annotations (see master feat changes section).</li>
      </ul>
      <ul style="list-style-type: circle;"><b>Firearms Redux</b>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Availability</i> - This campaign allows the purchase of primitive firearms. Advanced firearms can only be acquired as a specific loot drop. Modern firearms are prohibited.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Bulletproof</i> - Creatures wearing adamantine armor or wielding an adamantine shield, creatures with 25+ natural armor, or creatures possessing DR/-, DR/adamantine, or DR/epic of any amount, are not subject to the armor-penetrating qualities of firearms or siege weapons, and those weapons attack their regular AC.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Bullet-Resistant</i> - A firearm or siege weapon must be at least +1 to penetrate (and ignore) heavy shields and medium armor, and they must be at least +2 to penetrate tower shields or heavy armor. Creatures with natural armor equal to or greater than 5x the weapons enhancement bonus (minimum 5) are also not penetrated.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Fatal Dice</i> - (2e) All firearms gain Fatal Dice: When a critical hit is confirmed against a creature, the damage die increases two steps before damage is rolled.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Penetration</i> - (2e) All firearms gain Penetration: When a natural 20 is rolled when using a bullet (regardless of whether or not the attack is a critical hit), and the firearm is successfully penetrating the targets armor, the shot penetrates the target and continues on the same trajectory until it passes through the square of a creature or object, up to a total maximum distance traveled of the weapons first range increment. If the bullet passes through another creatures square, the shooter makes an attack against that target at a -2, while if it collides with an object it simply deals damage. Bullets may penetrate through multiple targets.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Siege Weapons</i> - (2e) All siege weapons gain the ability to target touch AC as though they were a firearm. All piercing siege weapons also gain the Penetration ability of firearms. All siege weapon with a x3 or x4 critical also gain the Fatal Dice ability of firearms.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul style="list-style-type: circle;"><b>Hero Points (Replaces Inspiration System)</b>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Gaining Hero Points</i> - Every character starts with one, and gains one each time they level. They also gain hero points following the holidays calendar rules, on their birthday, and rarely as rewards for things (such as completing major story arcs, a deific boon, performing particularly heroic acts, etc.)</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Limitations</i> - Maximum of 3 Hero points per character, which do not transfer between characters. You can only spend 1 hero point per encounter, except to cheat death. Spells, items, and abilities that affect hero point pools cannot be used by player characters.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Uses of Hero Points</i> - While the GM is the final arbiter of the extent of the power of a hero point, and may veto or adjudicate any use, these are some example uses.
          <ul style="list-style-type: lower-greek;">
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Act Out of Turn</i> - Move your initiative as though you had just un-delayed. You are restricted to one standard action (no swift), as though you were acting in a surprise round.</li>
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Cheat Death</i> <b>(THIS COSTS 3 HERO POINTS)</b> - When you would be slain, you can instead be reduced to 0hp (or current hp if lower) and stable. Whatever would have killed you will change targets to something else despite its instincts, if it can, unless you re-engage it.</li>
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Flashback (BitD)</i> - Have a flashback to a earlier time where one action was made (up to one roll), which can change the story going forward (ex. I bought a dose of holy water when we were last in town, I made arrangements for the duke to meet us here, I asked my contact to smuggle a lockpick into this room). <b>NOTE:</b> You cannot use this to change something that already happened (ex. actually i killed him in his sleep so he's already dead, I tied him up before we started combat.)</li>
            <li style="display: none;"><i>I Have an Idea</i> - Allows the attempt and <i>potential</i> success of something that would ordinarily be impossible, though that does not mean the attempt will work (ex. cast a spell you don't have but could otherwise cast, use foraged herbs instead of expensive spell components, wall-bounce out of a pit with using acrobatics instead of climb).</li>
            <li style="display: none;"><i>I Know a Guy</i> - Generate a previously unknown friendly npc/contact into existence, or generate a previously unknown skill in an existing npc of the GMs choosing.</li>
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Inspiration</i> - Receive divine inspiration (typically via the characters patron), getting a hint or instruction directly from the GM that they believe is helpful. If the GM has no advice, this doesn't cost a point.</li>
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Rally</i> - Lower your current fear level by one step.</li>
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Reroll</i> <b>(Most Common Use)</b> - Reroll any d20 roll you just made before the result is revealed.</li>
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Take-Backs</i> - Fix a mistake made earlier in your turn or within the last round (ex change movement, draw different weapon, forgot to use Power Stance, wanted to heal before the door was opened).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul style="list-style-type: circle;"><b>Mental Checks</b>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>How they Work</i> - All mental checks are straight d20 rolls where the objective is to roll lower than or equal to your respective ability score. This is opposed to physical ability checks, which are straight d20 rolls plus the ability modifier. In these specific instances, rolling a natural 20 is always a failure.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Memory Checks (INT)</i> - Used to see if your character remembers something, even if the player doesn't.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Morale Checks (WIS)</i> - Used to see if a creatures morale breaks in a fight (see morale), adding any bonuses they have versus fear effects to their Wisdom score (like bravery).</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Chat Checks (Cha)</i> - Used to be conversation when the player doesn't want to role-play. This can include anything from general conversation at a party, to relaying information to an NPC, to giving a good come-back in a timely manner.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul style="list-style-type: circle;"> <b>Morale Checks</b>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>What is it?</i> - Morale checks determine when a creature loses their nerve in a fight.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Who rolls them?</i> - All players and creatures who are not mindless or immune to fear, have their own morale stat block, or are fighting to the death.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>When are they Rolled?</i> - When they become "Wounded" or "Disabled" in combat, their leader (or a friendly PC) is slain, or more than half their number are slain (if they don't have a leader).</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>What Happens on a Failure?</i> - They become "Shaken" until they rally or the end of the encounter.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>What about Rallying?</i> - Creatures get a morale check to rally if they are healed from "Wounded" or "Disabled" or their leader (or a PC) is brought back to life. They automatically rally if they are restored to full HP.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>When Morale Breaks</i> - When all creatures on one side of a fight is shaken (or worse) their morale breaks and they attempt to surrender or flee if they believe they can safely do so. If they cannot surrender or flee, they fight to the death.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul style="list-style-type: circle;"><b>Mounted Combat Rulings</b>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Adverse Movement</i> - Any effect that moves a mount without automatically moving the rider (Including Combat Manuevers) requires the rider to make a ride check (DC = moving effect +5 OR CMB +5) or they fall off. If it moves the rider and not the mount, they always fall off.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Falling</i> - A mount and its rider both take equal damage from falls. When a mount falls or is knocked prone, the Rider must succeed on a DC25 Ride check to make a soft fall, or they take an additional 2d6 points of falling damage. If a rider falls onto their mount, their mount takes half the rider's falling damage.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>High Ground</i> - Riding a mount that is larger than an enemy provides high ground, but does not provide cover.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Ill-Suited</i> - In addition to taking a ride penalty, the rider loses their ability score bonus to initiative when riding an ill-suited mount.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Initiative</i> - The duo always moves on the rider's initiative.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Overrun</i> - A rider initiating an overrun may use his mount in place of himself, while providing the mount bonuses to overrun from the rider's feats and class features.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Prone Mont</i> - If a mount is knocked prone, the rider must make a DC25 ride check to make a soft fall, or they take 2d6 damage. If a rider takes any amount of damage from this, they fall off their mount.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Stacking</i> - A rider cannot simultaneously be a mount for a different creature, though a mount may potentially have both a rider and passengers.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Unconscious Rider</i> - If a rider is knocked unconscious, they have a 50% chance to stay in the saddle (75% chance if in a military saddle). Otherwise, they fall off and take an additional 2d6 points of damage. Without a rider to guide it, mounts avoid combat and obey their tricks.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul style="list-style-type: circle;"><b>Perception Redux</b>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Competing Skills</i> - Perception can be used to identify the correct skill to use, but cannot be used as a substitute for the correct skill. For example, perception might tell you a creature is wounded, but not the extent of the wounds (use heal); perception might notice signs of a hidden trail, but wont let you follow it (use survival).</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Detection</i> - (2e) Incorporate Detection Terminology
          <ul style="list-style-type: lower-greek;">
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Overview</i> - Detection determines how aware creatures are of each other. These states are relative to the viewer - its possible for a creature to be observed by you but hidden from your ally. Typically, the GM tracks how well creatures detect each other. Detection determines things like being caught off-guard, concealment, and surprise rounds, but are separate from things like cover. Higher states grant all the benefits of lower states, and use the lesser of conflicting penalties.</li>
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Observed</i> - You can "see" them, often without difficulty. You are not caught off-guard, you can attempt knowledge checks normally, and they cannot have total concealment (though they may have regular or improved concealment). If you are undetected or unnoticed, you get a surprise round if you initiate combat. Only precise senses (anything with sight or vision in its name) can observe a creature.</li>
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Hidden</i> - You have located a creature that is barely perceptible, and you know what space it occupies, but little else. Imprecise senses (such as scent or anything with "sense" in the name) can only raise detection up to this level.</li>
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Detected</i> - You know an enemy is present, but not where they are. They do not get a surprise round against you, or you get to act in the surprise round. You may attempt to target the enemy by guessing which square they are in, and may attempt knowledge checks against them at a -10 (or -5 if someone has observed it and can relay information). Very imprecise senses (such as normal hearing or smell) can only raise detection up to this level, though they may also give you directional information.</li>
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Unnoticed</i> - (UI) While a creature is detected in some fashion, maybe even observed, you do not know they are an enemy. If they initiate combat, they can attempt a Bluff check versus Sense Motive to get a surprise round; if they fail, their detection level rises to the appropriate level. Disguise and social maneuvers cannot lower detection below this state.</li>
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Undetected</i> - (CRB) You have no idea a creature is even present. They are not valid targets for abilities, and if they initiate combat, they gain a surprise round which you do not act in, and you are caught off-guard. They have total concealment (50% miss chance).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Initiative</i> - You can only roll for initiative once an enemy is detected. If you were distracted by an activity when initiative is rolled, you use the skill check relative to the activity you were doing as your initiative and act one round delayed.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul style="list-style-type: circle;"><b>Social Maneuvers Redux (not verbal duels)</b>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>What is it?</i> - Social Maneuvers are a collection of special attacks, like combat maneuvers, that are done with Charisma. The DC for all Social Maneuvers is 10 + their opposed skill bonus (diplomacy vs diplomacy, sense motive vs bluff or intimidate). Each social skill has both fast Social Maneuvers which may be done during combat as a standard action, and a slower Social Maneuvers which may not be attempted during combat. None of these Social Maneuvers have any effect on mindless creatures.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Bluff Maneuvers</i> - These Social Maneuvers use the Bluff skill opposed by your opponents Sense Motive, and are often dishonorable. The maneuvers are modified by the modifiers outlined in bluff.
          <ul style="list-style-type: lower-greek;">
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Feint</i> - (Standard Action) You use Bluff in combat to cause your opponent to be denied their Dexterity bonus to AC against your next attack made before the end of the next round. If your opponent is not well trained in Sense Motive, use their HD + Wis modifier to determine the DC to feint. You take a -4 penalty when attempting to feint against a non-humanoid, and a -8 penalty when attempting to feint against a creature with an intelligence of 1 or 2.</li>
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Feign Harmlessness</i> - (Full-Round Action) You attempt to convince your enemies that you are of no threat to them. If you are at least one size category smaller than your target and have taken no visible offensive actions, you gain a +5 bonus on this check. Even if you have proven yourself capable, you can attempt to present your previous success as a one-time fluke with a -10 penalty.</li>
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Coax</i> - (1 minute) You can attempt to coax a target into thinking that a suggestion of your is their own idea. This requires you first making a far-fetched bluff check, followed by an indifferent make request action through diplomacy, which is usually too difficult to accomplish during combat..</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Diplomacy Maneuvers</i> - These Social Maneuvers use the Diplomacy skill opposed by your opponents Diplomacy, and cannot be attempted on creatures that do not share a language with you, except for animals if you have the wild empathy ability. You gain a +5 bonus on these Social Maneuvers when attempting them against friendly creatures, and conversely take a -5 and -10 penalty respectively when attempting them against unfriendly or hostile creatures.
          <ul style="list-style-type: lower-greek;">
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Make Request</i> - (Standard Action) If a creature's attitude toward you is at least indifferent, you can make requests of them. Once a creature is helpful, they give in to most requests without needing a check. If the request goes against the creature's nature, its core values, or puts it in serious peril, however, the request may instead automatically fail subject to the GMs discretion, though a helpful creature may offer an alternative that honors the spirit of the request. See diplomacy for modifiers for requests being simple or conversely being complicated, lengthy, secretive, or dangerous.</li>
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Call Truce</i> - (1-Round Action) While in combat, you can call for a truce. When doing so, you can't be wielding a weapon or other threatening implement, and must be in plain sight of most of the creatures you're entreating. Once you've called for a truce, if any of your allies attack or take threatening actions against those you are entreating before the start of your nex turn, your call is unsuccessful. At the start of your next turn, you may attempt a single Diplomacy check against the hostile groups leader or the one with the highest bonus to diplomacy. If you are successful, combat ceases for 1 minute, or until any creature in the opposing group is threatened or attacked. If this parley would inherently result in the opponents surrendering or losing, pausing is inherently dangerous, or they are fighting to the death, the call automatically fails.</li>
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Influence Starting Attitude</i> - (1 minute action) You can improve the starting attitude of an NPC by for 1d4 hours. This is generally ineffective in combat or against creatures that intend to harm you or your allies in the immediate future.</li>
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Socialize</i> - (At least 10 minutes, usually 1 hour, up to 8 hours) You attempt to permanently improve the attitude of the target. This typically has a set DC, but a suggested DC is their normal diplomacy DC plus their HD. If social rounds are being used instead, see those for more information.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Intimidate Maneuvers</i> - These Social Maneuvers use the Intimidate skill opposed by your opponents Sense Motive. You get a +4 size bonus on these maneuvers if you are larger than your target, and a -4 penalty if you are smaller. Failed intimidate checks can usually be retried at a stacking -5 penalty which resets after one hour.
          <ul style="list-style-type: lower-greek;">
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Demoralize</i> - (Standard Action) You attempt to give your the shaken condition, though this cannot stack with other shaken conditions to make an affected creature frightened. If you are successful, they are shaken for 1 round, plus 1 round for every 5 by which you beat the DC. You can only threaten an opponent this way if they are within 30 feet and can clearly see and hear you. Using this ability again can extend the duration.</li>
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Challenge</i> - (Full-Round Action) You challenge your target to a duel. They must be within 30 feet and can clearly see and hear you. On a success, they enter a duel with you (following duel rules according to their honor) and cannot withdraw from the duel for 1 round + 1 additional round for every 5 by which you beat the DC.</li>
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Cow into Submission</i> - (1 minute) You attempt to force an opponent to act as though they are friendly for 1d6 x 10 minutes. Whether not this is successful, the targets true attitude falls to no better than unfriendly, and they may report you to the authorities.</li>
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Coerce</i> - (1d4 x 10 minutes) <b>This is an Evil act!</b> You can coerce someone into acting as though they are friendly as though you are cowing them into submission for 1d6 hours + 1 hour for every 5 points by which you beat the DC. If you successfully use this ability on the same creature at least once per week for 1d6 weeks without ever failing a check against the target, the duration of this coercion increases to 2d8 days with each check. The creatures true attitude becomes hstile, and if they believe that can take action against you that can't be traced back to them, or enlist aid against you, are likely to take such opportunities.</li>
          </ul>        
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul style="list-style-type: circle;"><b>Unchained Systems</b>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Background Skills</i> - Approved, along with Artistry and Lore. Players may argue their case for using Artistry, Lore, or Profession skills in place of regular skill checks. All Lore choices should be discussed with the GM.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Classes</i> - Mandatory replacement for non-unchained versions. Classic Monk only allowed with specific archetypes that cannot be used with the unchained monk. Barbarians, Bloodgragers, Skalds, and archetypes granting rage may use traditional or unchained rage, but are encouraged to use unchained version.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Diseases and Poisons</i> - Generally use as a replacement for poisons and diseases in game, which helps them to scale more evenly with levels (not overpowered followed by irrelevant).</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Dynamic Magic Item Creation</i> - Fully implemented, replacing standard magic item crafting. While perks will not increase sale values, they may increase barter/trade acceptance. Quirks or flaws may lower value or prevent a sale at GM's discretion. Cursed items can never be sold. [GM NOTE: Look at perks/quirks/flaws often when selling unique merchant loot]</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Expanded Craft, Perform, and Profession Rules</i> - Approved, framework for manual crafting and other background skills.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Fractional BAB</i> - Mandatory</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Skill Unlocks</i> - Approved, requires signature skill feat, which can only be taken once (stacks with rogues ability).</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Stamina and Combat Tricks</i> - Approved, can be taken as the Combat Stamina Feat. Fighters get this feat for free at 1st level.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Wild Magic</i> - Implement boost casting option. Wild magic table is used for spells lost to concentration, arcane failure, counterspelled spells, casting in wild zones(always noticeable), and failed attempts at boost casting. Wild magic rolls imitating a higher-level spell than the expended slot, or with an inappropriate effect, defaults to the universal surge effects table instead.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Wounds</i> - Use 50% wound threshold system, add "Wounded" to status and deathwatch spells, and keep adjustments to disabled replacing staggered condition.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul style="list-style-type: circle;"><b>Other Systems</b>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Critical Saving Throws (2e)</i> - When making a saving throw, rolling a natural 1 or 20 have additional effects. With a nat20, the subject suffers no effects, including damage (like evasion) or any other effects that normally still apply on a successful saving throw, as though they were not targeted. With a nat1, the subject suffers double all hostile effects (damage, duration, etc.) and may not make subsequent saving throw attempts to end ongoing effects (like <i>hold person</i>).</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Horror Adventures (HA)</i> - Use corruptions as a replacement for default transformations into vampires, lycanthropes, etc.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Massive Damage (CRB)</i> - Creatures are subject to massive damage if the take more than 50 points of damage from a single attack which is also more than half they total hp. They must make a Fortitude save (DC10 + 1/10 damage taken) or immediately die.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Medicine (2e)</i> - Implement "Treat Wounds" as a heal action. Treat wounds is a 10 minute action that cannot be performed on the same character more than once per hour or more than a number of times per day equal to their Con modifier (minimum 1). They may be attempted a number of times per day equal to the healer's ranks in the heal skill, with a DC of 15, and each attempt requires one dose from a healer's kit. If successful, the subject heals 1/hp/HD up to a maximum equal to their CON score. By Spending 1 hour and 2 charges from a healer's kit, the healer may instead attempt to "Treat Deadly Wounds" with a DC20 to heal double what would've been healed with "Treat Wounds." A Character may only benefit from "Treat Deadly Wounds" once per day. Any affect that alters how much healing is done via "Treat Deadly Wounds" applies half its benefits to the "Treat Wounds" action.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Occult Adventures (AO)</i> - Can be used by any player that wants to use them, including chakras, occult rituals, occult skill unlocks, and psychic duels.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Retraining (UC)</i> - Always available, see pdf attachment for more information.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Scars (CRB)</i> - Any time a character takes enough damage in a single encounter to become "Wounded," they develop a minor scar - something that regular healing magic and rest doesn't heal. Minor scars are interesting but otherwise entirely cosmetic, though a player may wish to record them. If a character suffers massive damage (even if they succeed on their saving throw) they develop a major scar, such as a cut on the face, loss of a finger or ear, or even the loss of a limb. The GM or player should decide the results of a major scar or roll on the table for scars and wounds. <i>Regenerate</i> and similar effects heal scars.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Six-Second Rule (CRB)</i> - Except for the first player to act, if it takes you longer than 6 seconds to decide what you want to do in combat, you automatically delay until you are ready to act.</li>

          <br>&emsp; <i>Greater Shield Focus</i> - Shield bonus also applies against all ranged touch attacks (including rays). If a ranged touch attack misses because of this bonus, resolve its effects against the shield.</li>

        <li style="display: none;">Cold Water Gasp - A warm-blooded creature who falls or is dropped into cold water (uncontrolled) and plunges at least 10 feet gasps in cold water and must immediately begin making fortitude saves as though they ran out of air.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Being Strangled - Spells or abilities that force you to hold your breath while already holding your breath (like a chokehold) doubles your air expenditure each round.</li>

      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"> <b>What happens when I run out of air?</b>
        <li style="display: none;">Check - If you cannot breath at the start of your turn, you must make a Con check (not Fort) with a DC of 10 + 1 for each previous check attempted.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Spells - You cannot speak or use spells or abilities with verbal components.</li>

      <h3>Tell me about Buoyancy and Currents...</h3>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><b>How does Buoyancy work?</b>
        <li style="display: none;">Why does it matter? Buoyancy determines how much you float or sink in the water when you fail (or don't attempt a needed) a swim check, whether you can walk underwater on the sea floor, and how easy or hard it is to swim up or down.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">What action is it to resist my buoyancy? Attempting to resist your Buoyancy is a free action at the start of your turn (or done as part of a move action), with the same Swim DC as attempting to move.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Neutral Buoyancy - If you have neutral buoyancy, you do not float or sink relative to where you are in the water, and you don't need to attempt a swim check to resist your buoyancy.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Rising/ Sinking - If you have rising or sinking buoyancy and fail a swim check (or don't resist), at the start of your turn, you are moved in the direction of your buoyancy. This movement knocks you off-balance and provokes attacks of opportunity. You move 10 feet on the first round, 20 feet on the second round, and 30 feet every round after.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Swift Buoyancy - If you have swiftly rising or sinking buoyancy, you must attempt a DC20 swim check at the start of your turn, or you are moved in the direction of your buoyancy 30 feet. This movement knocks you off-balance and provokes attacks of opportunity. If swiftly rising and already at the surface, you are not off-balance and may choose to stay at the surface without making any swim checks. If swiftly sinking and on a stable surface, you are not off-balance and may choose to stand on the bottom or move normally as though in difficult terrain.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Changing Buoyancy - If your buoyancy changes while being moved by your buoyancy, your buoyancy speed changes at a rate of 10 feet per round. If your buoyancy changes to swiftly rising/sinking, your buoyancy speed changes immediately.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Moving vs Buoyancy - If moving against your buoyancy (and its not neutral), you are treated as though you are moving through difficult terrain and your speed is halved (like going upstairs). If moving with your buoyancy, you may choose to move your buoyancy speed at the start of your turn (provoking normally) before attempting your swim check to move, effectively adding your buoyancy to your total movement.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><b>What is my Natural Buoyancy?</b>
        <li style="display: none;">Water Subtype - If you have the water subtype, your buoyancy is always neutral (even if affected by magic or items).</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Aquatic Subtype - If you have the aquatic subtype, you may change your buoyancy to neutral as a free action at the start of your turn (unless your buoyancy is swiftly rising/ sinking). If your buoyancy is already neutral, you may change it to rising or sinking as a move action.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Air Subtype - If you have the air subtype, your buoyancy is swiftly rising if your in a light load, rising if your in a medium load, and sinking if your in a heavy load.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Air Breathers - If you are a creature that needs to breath (like humanoids), your buoyancy is sinking if in a light, and swiftly sinking if in a medium or heavy load or wearing heavy armor.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Non Breathers - If you are a creature that does not need to breath (like constructs), your buoyancy is sinking if in a light load, and swiftly sinking if in a medium or heavy load or wearing medium or heavy armor.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><b>What can change my Buoyancy?</b>
        <li style="display: none;">Water Subtype - nothing. The only way for a creature with the water subtype to not have neutral buoyancy is for it to change its subtype (such as via a polymorph effect)</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Aquatic Subtype - If you are not swiftly rising/ sinking, you can adjust your buoyancy to neutral at the start of your turn as a free action. If your buoyancy is neutral at the start of your turn, you may change it to rising or sinking as a move action.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Magic - Certain spells and abilities (like <i>aquakinesis</i> or <i>extreme buoyancy</i>) can change a creatures buoyancy.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Equipment - Certain items can be sued to adjust your buoyancy, such as air tanks and lead anchors. The magnitude of their effect depends on your Natural Buoyancy.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Load - Picking up or dropping items to change your load can adjust your buoyancy.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><b>How is this different from currents?</b>
        <li style="display: none;">Why does it matter? Like Buoyancy, a current can move you in the water. However, a current is an outside force and may move you in any direction.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Moving Water -  Any water with a current at any speed is considered moving water. Even the ocean is considered still water in absence of a current. A current moves a person 5 feet per round for every 2 mph.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Resist Currents - Just like Buoyancy, you can resist the current as the same free action as resisting your buoyancy at the start of your turn, or as part of a move (typical DC 10-20).</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Swept Away - If you fail (or choose not) to resist the current, you are moved by the current in the currents direction according to its speed. Unlike Buoyancy, this does not speed up or slow down. This movement knocks you off-balance and provokes attacks of opportunity from creatures not being swept away.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Moving vs Currents - Moving against the current counts as difficult terrain and your speed is halved (like going upstairs). If moving with the current, you may choose to be swept away at the start of your turn (provoking normally) before attempting your swim check to move, effectively adding the currents speed to your total movement.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How far can I move underwater?</h3>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><b>I have a swim speed!</b>
        <li style="display: none;">You may move up to your swim speed as a move action without making a swim check (except for extreme circumstances)</li>
        <li style="display: none;">You may choose to move one quarter a different speed if you like, but you gain none of the benefits of your swim speed on that movement (including your +8 bonus on swim checks).</li>
      </ul>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><b>I have <i>freedom of movement / free swim</i>!</b>
        <li style="display: none;">You automatically succeed on all swim checks and may choose to ignore buoyancy.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">You still move one quarter your speed as a move action.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">You may move your full fly speed as a move action (<i>freedom of movement</i> only, not <i>free swim</i>).</li>
      </ul>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><b>I can ignore difficult terrain!</b>
        <li style="display: none;">You may move one quarter your chosen speed with a successful swim check (DC 10-20) as a move action.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">You may move against your buoyancy or against the current without further reducing your speed.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">You may walk along the bottom at full speed as a move action if you have a swiftly sinking buoyancy.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><b>I have fly, burrow, fast movement, normal movement, etc.</b>
        <li style="display: none;">You may move one quarter your land, fly, or burrow speed with a successful swim check (DC 10-20) as a move action, or one half as a double move.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">You may move half your land or climb speed as a move action if walking/ climbing along the seafloor or another stable surface, as though moving in difficult terrain. This usually requires a swiftly sinking buoyancy.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><b>I have non-neutral buoyancy, but I'm not being dragged.</b>
        <li style="display: none;">You must attempt a swim check each round as a free action at the start of your turn to maintain your depth, or as part of your move action to move.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">If you fail your swim check, you move in the direction of your buoyancy. This knocks you off-balance and the movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">You may attempt to move normally with one of your movement speeds, but moving against your buoyancy counts as difficult terrain.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">You may allow yourself to be dragged by your buoyancy as a free action at the start of your turn. This knocks you off-balance and the movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><b>I am or I want to be dragged by my buoyancy or the current.</b>
        <li style="display: none;">You may allow yourself to be dragged by your buoyancy or the current as a free action at the start of your turn. This knocks you off-balance and the movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">You may attempt to not be dragged by your buoyancy or the current as a move action at the start of your turn (Dc 10-20). A success means you stop moving through the water and are no longer off-balance. You may only attempt this action once each turn.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">If swiftly rising and at the surface, you are no longer off balance and may act normally.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">If swiftly sinking and on a stable surface, you are no longer off balance, may act normally, and may walk at half speed (as though on difficult terrain), burrow normally, or climb against the ground at full (climb) speed.</li>

      <h3>How do water environments affect...</h3>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><b>...fighting at the surface?</b>
        <li style="display: none;">Surface Tension - Surface tension is real in pathfinder, which dictates how attacks, spells, and extradimensional spaces function underwater. Any time the two parties fighting each other are fighting through surface tension (such as one party being on land while the other is underwater, or the parties being separated by oil etc.), these rules apply.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Total Cover - Creatures completely separated by surface tension have total cover from one another's attacks (including spells).</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Partial Cover - Creatures not completely separated by surface tension, but more than half of them is (such as submerged chest-deep in water) gain improved cover. Creatures less than half separated but still separated gain regular cover (such as wading through waist-high water). Creatures still mildly separated gain partial cover (such as walking through water just deep enough to still be difficult terrain, but not stepping in a puddle).</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Exception to Cover - Creatures that are both in the same body of liquid at one end of the surface tension, or who are both disrupting the same surface tension (such as both wading through the same water) do not have cover from each other. Spellcasters must choose which side of the surface tension (such as above or below the water line) is affected by their spell, it still cannot penetrate surface tension.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Piercing Weapons - Attacks that deal piercing damage can ignore the cover benefit provided by surface tension, but they take a -2 penalty on attack rolls to do so.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><b>...concealment and detection?</b>
        <li style="display: none;">Maximum Visibility - In clear water, maximum visibility is typically 4d8x10 feet (40 - 320). In murky water, maximum visibility is typically 1d8x10 feet (10 - 80). In open water, it is difficult to gain cover or concealment for stealth without swimming away from your target at least the distance of maximum visibility.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Visual Perception - All visual perception checks are made at a -2 in clear water, and between -2 and -8 in murky water (all flowing water is at least somewhat murky). In addition, creatures without the amphibious special quality, aquatic subtype, or water subtype take a -4 on visual perception checks and risk eye injury if they are not wearing some form of protective goggles.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Audible perception - While sound travels farther and faster underwater, the benefits are usually mitigated by ambient noise. In situations with particularly little ambient noise (such as no wildlife or in a sealed tank), audible perception checks gain a +2.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Scent - Creatures with keen scent, like sharks, can track blood trails from up to a mile away, making it easier to track wounded targets underwater. Regular scent works normally underwater ofr aquatic creatures, but is more tuned for detecting things at long distance. Land-based creatures typically cannot use scent underwater.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Tremorsense - Aquatic tremorsense detects disturbances in the water and functions as long as both creatures are touching the same body of water. Regular tremorsense works normally so long as both creatures are touching the same solid surface.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Tracking - Without keen scent, it is nearly impossible to track creatures underwater unless they are moving along the bottom or through something that leaves signs (like a coral reef). Even in such exceptional circumstances, water quickly washes away signs of passage, increasing the DC to track in such situations by 1 for every 10 minutes in an area without a current, and by 1 for every minute in an area with a current.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><b>...temperature?</b>
        <li style="display: none;">Why does it matter? Immersion in water causes hypothermia more easily, and have a different temperature range from the surface for what is considered cold.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Temperature range - 80* and above are generally considered safe. 60*-80* is the same as cold weather, and a creature must pass a fortitude save each hour or take 1d6 points of nonlethal cold damage. 40*-60* is treated as severe cold, requiring a save every 10 minutes or dealing 1d6 nonlethal cold damage. 32*-40* is extreme cold and deals 1d6 lethal cold damage each minute. Liquid water below 32* deals 2d6 cold damage per minute.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Overheating - Heat dangers are rare in the water except in the presence of hydrothermal vents, as even the most extreme temperatures tend to cap around 104*.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Protection - <i>Endure elements</i> protects its target from water as cold as 32* (as opposed to -50* in air), which is usually enough protection. Sea creatures are generally adapted to the water temperature of their habitat.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><b>...dealing with pressure?</b>
        <li style="display: none;">Air, Aquatic, and Water Subtype - Creatures with the air subtype can adapt to pressure normally, but they treat the surface as their native zone, adapting to pressure all at once when returning to the surface from underwater. Creatures with the aquatic subtype are native to one oceanic zone (for most aquatic creatures, especially ones can also walk on the surface, that is usually the sunlight zone). Creatures with the water subtype are always considered native to all oceanic zones and cannot take damage from pressure.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Surface Dwellers - Creatures not native to underwater environments treat the 0-100 feet underwater as their native pressure range.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Outside Native Zone - Creatures outside of their native zone must succeed at a fortitude (DC15 + 1 per minute after the first) save every minute or take 1d6 points of damage, plus 1d6 points of damage for every 100 feet beyond the first. Example: Dave the land dweller (native range 0-100 feet) is 220 feet below the surface, and has been below his native zone for 3 rounds. This round, he must make a DC18 Fortitude save or take 2d6 damage</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Adapting to Pressure - Creatures outside their native zone adapt to pressure after making 5 fortitude saves (does not need to be consecutive), at which point their native zone shifts by 100 feet. Example: Dave the land dweller (native range 0-100) is 220 feet below the surface. After making 5 Fortitude saves, his adapted native range is 100-200 feet. After making 5 more saves, his adapted native range is 200-300 feet an he no longer needs to attempt fortitude saves, though he will experience pressure hazards when he ascends back to the surface.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Teleportation - Creatures instantly transported to a depth outside their native zone immediately being making saves as normal and may be in danger is the discrepancy in depth is vast. Aquatic creatures instantly transported back to their native zone after being adapting to being outside it take damage and make saves normally, but adapt completely to their native zone after making 5 fortitude saves.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Dealing with Pressure - The easiest and safest way to deal with pressure is to adjust depths gradually. Alternatively, spells like <i>freedom of movement</i>, <i>life bubble</i>, and <i>pressure adaptation</i> can prevent or overcome pressure damage.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle;"><b>...equipment?</b>
        <li style="display: none;">Environment - Salt water is incredibly harsh, and few materials can remain submerged for long without disintegrating or corroding. Leather, paper, wood, and textiles disintegrate quickly underwater and become worse than useless, often hampering movement, while metals rust and corrode away. A great deal of sensitive equipment also becomes permanently destroyed underwater, as the pressure breaks through formerly sealed environments and particles and detritus sabotage working parts.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Other Mundane - Unprotected items (or magical items that have been submerged for a long time) vulnerable to salt water take 1d6 points of damage from the salt water every day which bypasses hardness. If the item had the fragile quality or a hardness of 0, it is always destroyed. Sensitive equipment (such as a compass) and items with the fragile quality is similarly destroyed if it takes any damage from pressure. Items submerged for 1 hour or longer underwater that isn't subsequently cleaned that day (such as washed if its clothing) take damage as if it was submerged for 1 day.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Magic - Most magical equipment is protected from basic water exposure and can usually weather prolonged exposure to salt water. As a general rule, Magical equipment can survive at least 1 day per 100gp in value before needing to make fortitude saves, and each DC10 fortitude save protects the item for one additional week. Magic that protects the caster from the effects of water (such as <i>endure elements</i>) also protect their gear. Items with a +3 enhancement or with any energy resistance or endure elements property are completely immune to salt water. Metals immune to rust are likewise immune to salt water. Items protected from time (such as via an <i>ungent of timelessness</i>) are affected by water much more slowly.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Special Materials - Most alchemically treated items have the same protection as magic items underwater. Adamantine (and other skymetals), Blackwood, Crystal, Darkwood, Dragonhide (if the dragon had a swim speed), Eel Hide, Elysian Bronze, Mithral, Spiresteel, Throneglass<!--AKA Glassteel-->, and Voidglass are immune to the effects of salt water. Salt water is lethal to Greenwood and Living Steel, and any amount of damage from salt water destroys the materials ability to heal.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Primitive Materials - Many materials used underwater are considered primitive or useless above water. Bone, Coral, Obsidian, Shell, and Stone are protected from the effects of salt water, while Gold, Platinum, Silver, and other precious metals are non-corrosive and may serve a more-than-decorative purpose. In depths of 200+ feet, water pressure helps to hold these items together, and they lose the fragile quality (if they had it).</li>
      </ul>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><b>What are Oceanic Zones?</b>
        <li style="display: none;">General Info - Oceanic Zones describe the typical conditions of a specific depth, and oceanic life has typically adapted to one or more of these zone. Most surface dwelling creatures are not adapted to any of these zones.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Sunlight Zone - Depth: 0 - 660 feet. All aquatic plants that require light for photosynthesis exist here and is home to most marine mammals, aquatic humanoids, and fish familiar to most fisherfolk. Temperatures here are based on surface conditions (from 100*-30* typically). This zone has enough light to see with normal vision during the day.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Twilight Zone - Depth: 660 - 3,300 feet. With roughly 1% of light reaching this zone, there is not enough light for photosynthesis, and creatures typically feed on falling detritus. Despite this, roughly 90% of Golarion's fish live in this zone. Creatures with low-light vision can see to a distance of around 60 feet and treat the area as dim light. Many creatures in this zone rely on darkvision or other precise senses, while others are bioluminescent. The temperatures in this zone range from about 68* at the top to around 39* at the bottom with very few variations.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Midnight Zone - Depth: 3,300 - 13,000 feet. This zone has no light whatsoever from the surface, forcing creatures to use darkvision or on visual senses if it doesn't have its own light source, though light sources tend to attract predators. The creatures of this depth are the least understood and have the largest variety, though its hard for fish to live here, being forced to scavenge on sparse amounts of falling detritus. The temperature is usually 39* throughout, and the zone typically extends to the sea floor, with the average ocean depth being two miles.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Abyssal Zone - Depth 13,000 - 20,000 feet. This rare zone is devoid of even falling detritus, preventing event simple organisms from growing or forming on the seafloor at these depths except around hydrothermal vents. Nearly empty and devoid of life, only a few leviathans, giant squid, and tentacled horrors thrive in this zone, typically resting here and hunting in higher zones when they need to feed. The temperature is a consistent 35* - 39*.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Abaddonian Zone - Depth 20,000+ feet. Some scholars, particularly among deep sea races, theorize of this zones existence in the deepest ocean trenches. With pressures over 1,000 times that of the surface, combines with low temperatures and ambient magic, these trenches could house nightmarish tableau's that hardly seem possible on the Material Plane. While some scholars have funded expeditions to the Abaddonian zone, very few have survived a trip towards its depths, and none have returned sane enough to give any accounting or what they found or if they even reached its depths.</li>

      <h3>Okay, let's talk about combat!</h3>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><b>How does water normally affect different weapons?</b>
        <li style="display: none;">Piercing - Piercing weapons typically function normally underwater, though they take a -2 on attack rolls if the wielder is off-balance or breaching surface tension. They also only deal half damage if the wielder is off-balance.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Bludgeoning or Slashing - Weapons that deal bludgeoning or slashing damage typically take a -2 on attack rolls, deal half damage, and cannot breach surface tension.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Thrown Weapons - Thrown weapons take a -2 penalty on attack rolls for every 5 feet of water, and are typically too inaccurate to be effective unless thrown from directly above the target and using its buoyancy to reach it. Piercing weapons (such as spears) can be thrown from above the water in this manner taking the additional -2 on attack rolls for breaching surface tension.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Ranged Weapons - Ranged weapons not designed to be used underwater take a -2 penalty on attack rolls for every 5 feet of water. Underwater ranged weapons are designed to overcome this penalty, but typically have a reduced range. Piercing weapons (such as harpoons) can be fired from above the water at its target, taking the additional -2 on attack rolls for breaching surface tension.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Combat Maneuvers - Most combat maneuvers work normally underwater, but creatures without a swim speed take a -2 penalty on grapple combat maneuvers. Damage dealt via grapple and via attacks with the grab special ability deal full damage underwater, even if the damage is bludgeoning or piercing.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><b>How do you cast magic underwater?</b>
        <li style="display: none;">Holding Breath - Any time a creature is holding its breath (such as being underwater) and attempts to cast a spell, they must succeed at a concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) to cast a spell at all, even if it has no verbal components.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Verbal Components - Every spell/ability with a verbal component reduces your remaining breath by 3 rounds (must have at least 3 rounds left), or by 1 round if it has a casting time of swift or immediate (must have at least 1 round).</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Spell Components - Mundane spell components generally work fine underwater, and aquatic-appropriate substitutions exist for any mundane component that would be inherently impossible to use underwater.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Surface Tension - Spells cannot typically break surface tension, and creatures completely separated from you via surface tension have total cover from your spells.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Spell Descriptors - Certain spells work differently underwater, often determined by its spell descriptors. Check the "How does water affect different types of spells and abilities?" section for more information.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><b>What does it mean to be off-balance?</b>
        <li style="display: none;">What is it? Off-balance is a special state (not technically a condition) that provides a few combat adjustments.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">What does it adjust? A creature off-balance is treated as flat-footed, its piercing weapons become as ineffective in water as bludgeoning weapons, and its opponents gains a +2 on attack rolls against it.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">How does it happen? Generally, any time a creature fails a swim check or allows itself to be dragged by a current or its buoyancy, it becomes knocked off-balance. It can also be inflicted on a creature who would normally be knocked prone, such as via a trip, bull-rush, or overrun combat maneuver.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><b>How can I overcome all these penalties?</b>
        <li style="display: none;">Spells - A great many spells overcome the penalties of being underwater, with <i>freedom of movement</i>, <i>water breathing</i>, <i>endure elements</i>, and <i>life bubble</i> being the most all-encompassing and generally useful.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Swim Speed - Having a swim speed overcomes a lot of the penalties of being underwater, especially if it comes with water breathing.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Class Abilities - Many class abilities, options, and archetypes bypass or override the normal effects of fighting in water.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Combat Feats - Several combat feats and styles allow characters to live and fight underwater, with one of the most useful being aquatic combatant.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Metamagic Feats - Several metamagic feats allow casters to cast spells underwater with different or enhanced effects, such as murky spell, steam spell, or aquatic spell.</li>

      <h3>How does water affect different types of spells and abilities?</h3>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><b>Magical Acid</b>
        <li style="display: none;">Conjuration (creation) - These spells conjure acid to deal damage and are diluted by open water to the point where they become harmless (example, <i>acid splash</i>).</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Evocation - These spells deal raw acid damage and are unaffected by water (example, <i>fireball</i> affected by Elemental Spell metamagic).</li>
      </ul>
      </ul><ul style="list-style-type:circle"><b>Magical Clouds and Weather</b>
        <li style="display: none;">Bubble Spells - Bubble effects (such as <i>air bubble</i> and <i>invisibility bubble</i>) always work underwater and are often designed to work in environments where other spells of their type would not function.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Conjuration Clouds - Spells that conjure a cloud of something (like <i>fog cloud</i> or <i>glitterdust</i>) or mimic the effect of a conjuration cloud (like <i>virulent miasma</i>) do not function underwater unless they explicitly state otherwise.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Transmutation Clouds - Spells that turn something into a cloud (like <i>gaseous form</i>) and spells that mimic those effects do not function underwater.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Illusion, Enchantment, and Evocation Clouds - Illusory or Enchanting clouds and abilities function normally in the water, as they are not creating a real substance. Evocation clouds (like aggressive thundercloud) function normally, but cannot manifest its presence and dissipate after 1 round as if dispelled.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Wind effects - Wind effects cannot manifest underwater at all.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Weather Spells - Many weather spells adjust weather conditions on land (such as <i>sleet storm</i>) and cannot work underwater at all. Others only adjust conditions on the surface (such as <i>control weather</i>) and have limited effect at depths below the surface and near zero effect below 100 feet. Illusory effects, however, always function.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><b>Magical Cold</b>
        <li style="display: none;">Conjuration - Spells that conjure ice work normally underwater.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Cold Damage - Spells that deal cold damage (such as <i>cone of cold) that do not conjure cold directly instead deal half cold, half piercing damage as the cold creates jagged ice shards underwater.</i></li>
      </ul>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><b>Magical Electricity</b>
        <li style="display: none;">Ranged Touch Electricity - Spells that create electricity and deal damage at range hold their integrity enough to have normal effects underwater, except it lacks the normal visual and audible components of combusted air. Treat these spells as though they are invisible (+2 attack, target is flat-footed) the first time this type of spell is cast by that caster in combat. This effect cannot be overcome by abilities that detect only magical invisibility (such as <i>true seeing</i>) or rely on sound or scent to overcome invisibility (such as sonar) but can be otherwise overcome by blindsight.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Touch, Area of Effect, and Partial-Electricity spells - The electricity portion of these spells function normally.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><b>Magical Fire</b>
        <li style="display: none;">Non-magical Fire - Normal fire (including alchemist fire) does not function underwater at all.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Supernatural Fire - Most supernatural fire effects do not function underwater at all.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Magical Fire - Fire spells may transform into steam with the caster succeeding at a caster level check (DC 20+ spell level) dealing the normal amount of fire damage but without any secondary fire effects, such as igniting combustibles.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Steam Spells - Spells or abilities that already create steam (such as a kineticist's steam blast) function normally underwater.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><b>Magical Invisibility</b>
        <li style="display: none;">Regular Invisibility - Invisible creatures still displace water, and only gain concealment (20% miss chance) instead of total concealment underwater, just like during a rain storm.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Invisibility Bubble - This specific spell hides water displacement, and works normally underwater, though it only provides concealment out or water or in a rain storm.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><b>Magical Sonic Effects</b>
        <li style="display: none;">Option 1 - A caster of a sonic spell may choose for it to function normally.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Option 2 - A caster of a sonic spell may choose to double the spells rage in exchange for halving the damage and reducing any spell DCs by 2.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>I have an edge-case question about a specific thing...</h3>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><b>Using Potions Underwater</b>
        <li style="display: none;">Potions and extracts cannot normally be used underwater due to surface tension - It's not as much that the water dilutes the potion as much as the potion can't come out without air going in.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Potion Sponges are cheap and easy items that allow you to consume potions and extracts underwater. Also, any spell that creates a safe and breathable environment (like <i>life bubble</i>) allows you to drink potions underwater.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><b>Extradimensional Spaces</b>
        <li style="display: none;">Newly conjured extradimensional spaces use the surrounding environment for their atmosphere, so casting <i>rope trick</i> would create an extradimensional space filled with water if cast underwater. The exception to this are spells which also create an environment (like <i>Mage's Magnificent Mansion</i>).</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Due to surface tension, if the entryway of an existing extradimensional space moves to a new location, it retains its original atmosphere (if it had air, it still has air that can't be let out, if it had water it still has water that can't be let out).</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Extradimensional containers (like a bag of holding) are designed to maintain surface tension and only allow attended objects in and out (otherwise, they would rupture quickly after being overloaded). As such, a bag of holding remains filled with air underwater (unless a caster enters it and fills it with conjured water). However, if the container cannot replenish its fresh air/water supply in its new location, the air/water inside is considered stagnant and is not breathable.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Items removed from an extradimensional container while underwater are usually soaked through immediately. Should items be placed inside the container while underwater, enough water is able to breach the surface tension with the item to the generally get everything inside the bag wet, though not enough to weigh down the container. Wet items added to a bag above water tend to make many of the bags contents moist over time in the sealed environment. For this reason, it is often wise to keep certain items (like spellbooks) in a waterproof bag inside extradimensional containers if underwater adventuring is expected.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><b><i>Freedom of Movement</i></b>
        <li style="display: none;">Benefits and Limitations - This spell negates most of the penalties of being underwater, including dealing with pressure, making swim checks, dealing with difficult terrain (such as moving against a current), damaging equipment, and attack and damage penalties (such as using a slashing weapon). It does not, however, grant the ability to breathe underwater.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Normal Movement - <i>Freedom of Movement</i> allows a creature to move normally in their given environment. As creatures cannot walk in water, their land speed would still be 1/4 normal as they swim, they simply do not need to make checks, as it does not allow creatures to pretend water is solid enough to walk on (above or under water). It does allow a creature to walk along a stable surface (like the seafloor) underwater at full speed.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Other Forms of Movement - This spell enables creatures to travel at full speed with flight as though in air or with burrow as though underground. This spell does not allow creatures with abilities like earth glide to pretend that water is earth. It also does not allow creatures with a climb speed to pretend there are things they can climb against, just as it does not allow creatures to pretend there are things to walk on.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><b><i>Breath of Life</i></b>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>Breath of Life</i> may be used to rescue a drowning or drowned character, even underwater. In the event a creature drowned, they are treated as though they had taken damage equal to the amount required to slay them for the purposes of this spell.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">If a drowning creature is not healed enough to render them conscious and they still cannot breathe, they continue drowning normally. If a drowned creature is not healed enough to render them conscious and they still cannot breathe, they return to Step 2 of drowning, take 1 point of damage, and drown at the beginning of their turn.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">If a drowning or drowned creature is healed enough to become conscious and they still cannot breathe, they must immediately make a Con check at their previous DC + 1. If they fail, they resume drowning normally at Step 1.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul style="list-style-type: circle;"><b><i>Off-Balance Special Circumstance</i></b>
        <li style="display: none;">Causes - Failing a swim check, getting "knocked prone" while underwater or levitating or while riding or flying without being knocked to the ground or while "swimming" on land, or allowing yourself to be moved by someone or something else in a way that provokes attacks of opportunity while flying, riding, or swimming.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Penalties - You become flat-footed, you take a -2 on attack rolls, and enemies gain a +2 on attack rolls against you.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Resolution - You spend a move action to right yourself. This requires a swim check if underwater, a ride check if mounted, a fly check is in the air, or an acrobatics check (DC10, creatures with a land speed can take a 10) if on land.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul style="list-style-type: circle;"><b><i>Swimming in Unusual Terrain</i></b>
        <li style="display: none;">Water-like Terrain - This terrain include things that aren't water but are mostly water, such as: alcohol, bogs, dirty water, urine, or other viscous materials. Swimming in this terrain type uses the same rules as regular water, but water breathing creatures are exposed to anything in the water (like poisons) as if it was both ingested and inhaled, rolling against the higher DC (if varied). Creatures with the amphibious subtype gain a +4 bonus on fortitude saves against these effects.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Unusual Terrain - This terrain include things that aren't mostly water but could be swum through, such as: bile, flotsam, oil, quicksand, mucus, mud, slime, slush, and tar. Swimming in this terrain types is treated as difficult terrain, creatures with a swim speed cannot take a 10 in these environment, and such creatures only gain half the bonus of their swim speed on swim checks (+4 instead of +8). Creatures that can breathe water can still suffocate, but it takes twice as long.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Dangerous Terrain - This terrain includes anything that is naturally hazardous but could be (theoretically) swum through, such as: acid, burning oil or tar, crushing detritus, freezing icewater, or lava. Swimming in this terrain type is treated as difficult terrain, creatures with a swim speed cannot take a 10 and lose their, and such creatures do not gain the bonus of their swim speed on swim checks (+0 instead of +8). Many of these terrains are more readily navigated via other means.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Non-liquid-fluids - It is not normally possible to swim through these types of terrain, such as air, foam, steam, etc. However, when it is possible to swim through these terrains, it is treated as difficult terrain.</li>
