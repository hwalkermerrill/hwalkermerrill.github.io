				<p>The zebra is a distinctive member of the horse family, renowned for its striking black and white
					stripes that make it easily recognizable. Native to the grasslands and savannas, zebras are social animals
					often found in herds. Their unique stripe patterns serve as camouflage and a means of identification among the
					herd, while their strong, sturdy build enables them to travel long distances in search of food and water.
					Known for their agility and speed, zebras rely on their keen senses and cooperative behavior to evade
					predators in the wild.</p>

		<h2>Campaign Traits and Powers</h2>
		<strong>All living things may form a connection with the natural world around them. This connection often takes on
			the form of an eternal and unchanging bond with an animal spirit which, when awakened, guides and protects them
			through their dreams, life, and afterlife. </strong>
		<p>Each campaign trait requires the player to pick an associated totem; this totem must match or be compatible with
			the totem of any totemic-archetypes and spirit companions (or bonds) the player may have or later take. Players
			with animal companions and familiars are encouraged to choose companions that match or are compatible with their
			totem, though it is not required unless they have the totem-bonded archetype or are a shamans spirit. Eidolons and
			other spirit summons (like phantoms) will also have aspects of these totems, though they do not need to match
			exactly. Many monks and hunters often choose to emulate their totems when selecting animal aspects and styles.</p>
		<p>Properly awakening a creature's spirit totem requires undergoing a painful day-long ritual that includes
			tattooing their personal spirit totem prominently on their body. When awakened within a totem warrior or
			channeler, these manifest as additional bonuses gained while raging, while amongst creature with a totemic or
			animal power, such as totem transformation or animal aspect, these totems manifest as an alternate set of bonuses
			that can be selected. These bonuses only affect the creature with the awakened totem, not their companions, unless
			they have the totem-bonded archetype or otherwise have the same kind of totem. All other creatures instead gain a
			single daily use of totemic power, which they may activate as a move action, and lasts for 1 minute. </p>
		<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
			<li> Activating a totem causes the creatures tattoo to glow, and grants a small number of abilities. This is
				considered a polymorph effect. While in the form of their totem creature, such as via a dream journey or beast
				shape, they gain their totem abilities constantly and may use their totem magic during their transformation.
				<ol>
					<li>They become better able to communicate with animal species related to their totem, as though they had wild
						empathy (totem species only).</li>
					<li>They gain a +2 sacred bonus on skills listed under each totem. This bonus increases to +4 at 12th level.
					</li>
					<li>They gain an additional power, as outlined in the totemic magic section of each totem, with a caster level
						equal to their level.</li>

				<p><b>Description:</b> While you aren’t necessarily a native of Cheliax, you boarded the Jenivere at one of that
					country’s port cities. As the people of Cheliax generally know the Mwangi Expanse as a near legendary land
					home to strange beasts and exotic treasures, your views of the region have a distinctly romantic tinge, and
					the desire for fame, wealth, and adventure likely motivate your travels.</p>
				<p><b>Bonus:</b> You begin the campaign with a detailed map of the Mwangi Expanse (this grants +2 competence
					bonus on all Knowledge [geography] checks made regarding this region) and 200 gp worth of mundane equipment to
					aid your exploration of the jungle. </p>

				<p><b>Description:</b> Your travels have brought you to the Jenivere through the dangerous port of Ilizmagorti,
					home to both pirates and assassins. Perhaps you’re fleeing a price on your head, perhaps you’ve jumped ship
					from another vessel, or perhaps you’re merely looking for a new start in a land where the dangers make
					themselves more obvious. </p>
				<p><b>Bonus:</b> Your familiarity with subtle slayings and toxins grants you a +2 trait bonus on all saves
					against poison. In addition, you can pick one type of poison listed below to be immune to, having undergone a
					long and painful process of building up an immunity to its effects: blue whinnis, giant wasp poison, medium

					contiguous swarm, you don't leave your gear or bones behind, and you can revert to your mundane form as a
					standard action (or automatically as a full-round action when you are knocked unconscious or this effect
					expires). Damage taken in this discorporated form affect you normally.</p> -->

				<p><b>Description:</b> Your last home was in the Shackles, a dangerous land of pirates and treachery, but also

					them. </p>
				<p><b>Bonus:</b> This unusualness manifests in one of two ways. Choose to gain either a +2 trait bonus on all
					Bluff checks made against inhabitants of the jungle, or treat your spells with the mind-affecting descriptor

				<p><b>Description:</b> You come from a long line of Sargavan colonists, stretching back to Cheliax’s original
					expansion into the land during the Everwar. While your people’s control of Sargava wanes every day, and Eleder
					has functioned independently from Cheliax since House Thrune brought diabolism to the political forefront, you
					nevertheless maintain a hardy Chelish constitution and natural sense of survival. What took you away from home
					is up to you, but you return to the land of your birth on the <i>Jenivere</i> in the hope of putting Sargava
					back on the map. Characters with this trait are Sargavan natives and might be returning via any city, but
					especially from the Chelish ports of Kintargo, Pezzack, or Corentyn.</p>
				<p><b>Bonus:</b> You gain a +1 trait bonus on Knowledge (local) checks relating to Sargavan settlements and

				</picture>
				<p><b>Description:</b> Sea trade is never safe, even on the highly trafficked waters of the Inner Sea, but the
					way to Eleder is more perilous still. The ever-present hurricane known as the Eye of Abendego blows hundreds
					of ships each year off course, into jagged rocks, or directly to the sea floor. Pirates operating out of the
					Shackles Isles wait on the other side to take cargo from ships lucky enough to traverse or bypass the storm.
					Your job is to ensure a precious cargo aboard the Jenivere arrives safely in Eleder—what form this cargo takes
					and the nature of your relationship to it are up to you and your GM. Characters with this trait likely boarded
					in Magnimar, Corentyn, Ilizmagorti, Port Peril, or Bloodcove.</p>

				<p><b>Description:</b> This trip to Eleder is just one of many in a long career as a sailor aboard the

					servant, you now call the ship home. Characters with this trait have likely been on the Jenivere since it
					departed Magnimar.

				<p><b>Bonus:</b> Pick one of the following skills: Acrobatics, Climb, Knowledge (nature), Knowledge (geography),
					Swim, or Survival. You gain a +1 trait bonus on that skill, and that skill is always treated as a class skill

				<p><b>Description:</b> The Mwangi Expanse is one of the richest regions in all of Golarion, and also one of the
					most mysterious. Despite its history of countless years and its fostering of nameless empires, very little is

					studied the region and its lore, and count yourself among a small handful of genuine experts throughout the

					await firsthand investigation of the deep jungles and cyclopean ruins of Garund’s interior. Characters with
