						&nbsp;“The Guide informed us that the totems were not for sale, but Telgen was not dissuaded. 'Do you have
						any idea how much these would sell for in Oppara?' he asked, moon face gleaming under that ridiculous hat. I
						reminded him that, unlike his own people, the villagers might not be interested in selling off their
						ancestors for a handful of beads. He let the matter drop, but several miles later, he opened his bag to
						reveal three of the squat, grimacing carvings. Disgusted, our guide abandoned us, and we made camp.
						<br>&nbsp;"That night, Telgen took the ten. When we opened the flap next morning, he and the idols were
						gone. In his place was a flurry of bloody footsteps leading into the jungle - each just an inch long"

        <h3>Cloak of Passage</h3>
        <img src="/serpents/images/loot-cloak-of-passage.jpg" alt="Cloak of Passage">
        <p>A Boon of Barzahk, the Passage, these patchwork traveling cloaks are worn by those who have walked the Dead Roads with the Usher of Mortal Souls.</p>
        <p>These cloaks grant the wearer a resistance bonus to saving throws as <i>Cloaks of Resistance</i>, with a bonus equal to 1 plus the creatures experience as decided by the GM (typically 1/5 HD, or advancing by 1 for every completed book in an adventure path) with a maximum bonus of +5</p>
        <p>These cloaks are soul-bonded magical items, vanishing when removed and manifesting when the soul-bonded creature moves at least 5 feet. This item may be freely selected by a character with the arcane bond or implements abilities, or a similar effects, without any of the associated costs of changing a bonded item. For the purposes of bonded armor, this item counts as light or unarmed armor with no armor bonus, armor check penalty, or maximum dexterity.</p>
        <p>When a creature wearing the <i>cloak of passage</i> is subjected to a magical effect that sends them to a random plane, they are always sent to the Dead Roads in the Boneyard. Similarly, when such a creature is subjected to a teleportation effect, they always arrive on a suitable surface, and never take damage from being shunted to an appropriate space, though this protection does not extend to other passengers of such spells.</p>
        <p>These cloaks may be worn by creatures while in a corporeal or incorporeal form, though they may not be worn by undead and provide no benefit to creatures who are neither alive nor dead. While wearing one of these cloaks, any effect that prevents incorporeal creatures from passing, through, such as a <i>ghost-gate</i> or <i>anti-magic field</i> also prevents the wearer from passing through unless they first remove the cloak.</p>
        <p>Destruction: This cloak crumbles to ash if the creature it is soul-bonded with becomes undead.</p>

		<h2>Relics and Legacies</h2>
		<!-- Edit: add shield of acavna -->
		<p>Each relic was once a typical magic item that played a central role in a massively important event, increasing
			dramatically in potency as it drew power from its shaping of fate. Occupying a space somewhere between artifacts
			and magical items, relics are powered by Zeitgeist, using their storied history to enhance their powers, but as
			relics fade into obscurity and stories cease to be told, they wane in both power and potency. Typically, to
			restore a Relic to its full majesty, it must be used to accomplish a number of triumphs as stories are told of it
			anew. However, certain relics may be reawakened to its former glory by being used to fight the same evils they
			once faced by one who is worthy of it.</p>
		<p>The bearer does not need to know how to become worthy of a relic to reawaken it to its glory, but they always
			must be wielding the item when they accomplish its prescribed worthiness task. A reawakened relic only manifests
			its full glory to those who are worthy of it. Spellcraft may be used to identify the worthiness task in the same
			manner as determining an items curse (typically DC 25+CL).</p>

				<h3>Seaspike</h3>
				<img src="/serpents/images/seaspike.jfif" alt="Seaspike">
				<p>This elegant, short-hafted trident appears to be made from razor-sharp coral. A jade serpent wraps around the
					haft of the weapon before being impaled on the haft's spiked foot.</p>
				<p>Seaspike is treated as a light weapon for the purposes of Weapon Finesse and other similar abilities, and may
					be wielded as either a trident or a shortspear with the <i>+1 animal bane</i> special abilities. If a
					monstrous humanoid attempts to wield seaspike, they automatically drop the weapon at the end of their turn.
				</p>
				<p>Last, the wielder of Seaspike gains a bonus to fortitude saving throws against poison equal to twice the
					weapons enhancement bonus.</p>
				<!-- <p>Worthiness Task: ??</p> -->
				<p>Worthiness Task: The wielder must recover from three different poisons while holding this weapon, without
					other aid. Intentionally exposing themselves to poison does not apply for this ability. If the wielder ever
					uses poison against another, they become unworthy of seaspike.</p>
				<p>Glory: Further powers of Seaspike will be revealed when it is wielded by someone worthy of it.</p>
				<!-- <p>Glory: Seaspike's enhancement bonus increases to +3, and the bane special quality also applies against any serpent, including monstrous humanoids and magical beasts (at the GM's discretion). As a standard action, the wielder may attempt a single melee or ranged attack with seaspike to embed their weapon in their target. If successful, the target becomes entangled by the weapon. If the target is a serpent, they also take a penalty to natural attacks equal to Seaspike's enhancement bonus until the weapon is removed.
          <br>Special: If the wielder has vital strike, this special attack action counts as vital strike.
