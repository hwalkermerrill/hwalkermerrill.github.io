				<p>Fully assembled, this 14lb mithral spear bears the engraving "Orgē Aganakteō Ploúthos Agónizomai Perisseuó
					Horkos Euforía Anapauó Tímios Peri̱fánia," which roughly translates to "My Righteous Anger is Full, My (Zeal)
					is Overflowing, I Swear by (All I Love) [I Will] Lay You to Rest, and Let [Your Death] be My Glory." This
					spear appears to be the culmination of Savith's work as he pursued the serpentfolk diety, Ydersius. The spear
					glows corresponding to the spear's of Saventh-Yhi.
				</p>
				<p>The <i>Spear or Seven Parts</i> has a total enhancement bonus of +7 and is always considered an epic weapon
					with the ability to transform into any weapon from the spear weapons group and critical threaten any creature
					(even if they are normally immune to critical hits). Additionally, when the corresponding spear is
					illuminated, the bearer may exchange an equivalent amount of enhancement bonus to activate or deactivate the
					following, according to the color:
					<br>Red = <i>flaming</i> or <i>flaming burst</i>
					<br>Orange = <i>keen</i> or <i>vorpal</i>
					<br>Yellow = <i>defending</i> or <i>defiant</i>
					<br>Green = <i>ghost touch</i> or <i>brilliant-energy</i>
					<br>Blue = <i>returning</i> or <i>dancing</i>
					<br>Indigo = <i>monstrous-humanoid bane</i> or <i>furyborn</i>
					<br>Violet = <i>holy</i> or <i>nullifying</i>.
				<p>Additionally, when scoring a critical hit, this spear has enhanced abilities depending on what color it is
					glowing, as follows:
					<br>Red = Critical hits deal an additional 2d10 fire damage to all creatures within 15 feet of the target,
					except the wielder.
					<br>Orange = The <i>Spear of Seven Parts</i>' critical multiplier increases by one step.
					<br>Yellow = Critical hits cause this weapon to cast <i>dispel magic</i> on the target.
					<br>Green = Critical hits cause this weapon to <i>disrupt</i> and completely destroy the target if it is
					undead.
					<br>Blue = The extra damage caused by a critical hit is transferred to the wielder as healing. This healing
					is equal to the extra damage dealt to the target before they reached zero hit points.
					<br>Indigo = Critical hits affect the target as per the spell <i>dimension door</i>, but moving them to a
					space of the wielders choice within their line of sight and within 30ft. of the targets previous space.
					<br>Violet = Critical hits grant the wielder an additional attack using the same bonus as the original
					attack. This attack may target any creature within range, not just the target of the original attack. If this
					critical hit is the result of throwing the weapon, this additional attack is the result of a ricochet, and
					the new target must be within 30ft. of the original target.
				<p>Destruction: If the <i>Spear of Seven Parts</i> is dissembled and each piece taken to a different outer
					plane, wherein the bearer uses their fragment of the spear to commit a heinous act that is anathema to that
					planes foundation, the <i>Spear of Seven Parts</i> will loose its cohesion and disintegrate.</p>

					attack, and may use her red shroud and fading abilities each an additional time per day.</p>

				<p>This <i>Legendary Warrior Totem</i> depicts one of the 10 Magic Warriors of Old-Mage Jatembe, woven by the
					hands of a legendary spirit and imbued with the zeitgeist of the magic warriors themselves. This amulet acts
					as an <i>amulet of natural armor +2</i>. When worn by a creature with an associated awakened spirit totem,
					they may activate this <i>Legendary Totem</i> once per day when activating their totemic power, to commune
					with the spirit of the magic warrior for 1-minute. This unlock's their totem's legendary power, as well as
					granting them the shapechanger subtype, DR 10/silver, and the ability to instantly transform parts of their
					body into that of their totem animal as part of an attack action, granting all of the natural attacks (but not
					special attacks) possessed by their totem animal. These natural attacks count as magical, and deal half damage
					to swarms instead of none.</p>
				<p>It is rumored that Old-Mage Jatembe possessed a special totem of his own, one that can only be found by
					gathering together all ten magic warriors.</p>
				<p>Legendary Warriors Found: Azure Leopard.</p>
				<p>Destruction: If the wearer is slain while communing with the spirit of the magic warrior, the totem is
					destroyed and will need to be remade. Only one totem for each magic warrior can exist at a time.</p>

		<h2>Relics and Legacies</h2>
		<strong>Occupying a space somewhere between artifacts and magical items, relics are powered by Zeitgeist.</strong>
		<p>Each relic was once a typical magic item that played a central role in a massively important event, increasing
			dramatically in potency as it drew power from its shaping of fate. As relics fade into obscurity and stories of
			them cease to be told, they wane in both power and potency. Typically, to restore a Relic to its full majesty, it
			must be used to accomplish a number of triumphs as stories are told of it anew. However, certain relics may be
			reawakened to its former glory by being used to fight the same evils they once faced while being wielded by one
			who is worthy of it.</p>
		<p>The bearer does not need to know how to become worthy of a relic to reawaken it to its glory, but they always
			must be wielding the item when they accomplish its prescribed worthiness task. A reawakened relic only manifests
			its full glory to those who are worthy of it. Spellcraft may be used to identify the worthiness task in the same
			manner as determining an items curse (typically DC 25+CL).</p>

				<p>This <i>+1 rival-bane machete</i> applies the bane property against agents directly employed by a rival
					faction. To qualify as a rival faction, the leaders of both factions must acknowledge the other as a bitter
					blood-rival and a threat, with a direct financial incentive to eliminating the competitor; merely desiring the
					destruction of one-another is not enough. Additionally, this blade provides a +2 circumstance bonus on all
					survival checks, instead of the normal +1 on checks to get along in the wild.</p>
				<!-- <p>Worthiness Task: ???</p> -->
				<p>Worthiness Task: Eliminate a rival leader with an ironic fate worse than death.</p>
				<p>Glory: ???</p>
				<!-- <p>Glory: The <i>Blade of the Blood Feud</i> looks shiny and deadly when properly wielded, but appears dull and
					lifeless in the hands of others. The blade becomes a <i>+2 heart-seeking ominous rival-bane machete</i>, and
					the circumstance bonus it applies on survival checks increases to +6. If the wielder begins their turn or ends
					their movement next to a dying or disabled agent employed by a rival faction, the blade forces them to spend a
					standard action to attempt a touch attack to touch the blade to the agents throat. If successful, the agent
					must make a DC17 will save or die as though slain by a <i>death knell</i> spell, and the wielder gains the
					benefits as though they cast the spell. If the wielder attempts to resist this action, they must make a DC17
					will save to drop the blade.</p> -->

				<p>This bronze band is covered in geometric shapes and studded with tiny pearls. When within the boarders of
					Saventh-Yhi, the pearls glow with the colors of the seven spears, corresponding to whichever one is lit.</p>
				<p>The wearer of the <i>Ring of Seven Virtues</i> gains a constant <i>endure elements</i> effect and a +7
					competence bonus on survival checks. Also, even if the bearer has not been keeyed to the districts spear, they
					gain the benefits of that districts spear when within that district while the spear is lit. The bearer may
					also open the vault of the spear for any district thats currently lit.</p>
				<p>Worthiness Task: Gain access to the prismatic computer.</p>

				<h3>Rod of Well-Deserved Rest</h3>

					<source srcset="/serpents/images/loot-ring-seven-virtues.webp" type="image/webp">
					<img src="/serpents/images/placeholder.png" alt="Rod of Well Deserved Rest">
				</picture>
				<p>This rod appears to be made of polished gold, and features three blown-glass onion-shaped domes at one end.
					This functions as a <i>+1 light mace</i> when wielded as a weapon. Up to three times per day, with a
					successful hit in combat, the wielder may attempt to put the target of the attack to sleep (Will DC14
					negates). This functions as the <i>sleep</i> spell, but there is no limit to the Hit Dice that may be
					affected. Any creature put to sleep with this rod enters a dreamscape, which the wielder may choose to enter
					at will.</p>
				<p>Additionally, the wielder may create an opaque sphere of force to protect themselves from the elements once
					per day, as a <i>tiny hut</i> with a 5-foot radius. If the wielder goes to sleep with the rod in their
					possession, 2 hours of sleep is the equivalent of 8 hours of rest, and 8 hours of rest provides the equivalent
					benefits of a full day of bed rest, as well as granting the wielder the benefits of the <i>good hope</i> spell
					for 1 hour after waking.</p>
				<p>In any dreamscape, regardless of the wearers form, this rod may continue to be wielded, or passed to another
					creature. If the wielder is not a medium creature while in the dreamscape, they may wield the rod as though
					they were a medium creature.</p>
				<p>Worthiness Task: Fully attune to a dream totem (12th level).</p>
				<p>Glory: ???</p>
				<!-- <p>Glory: There is no longer a limit to the number of times per day that the wielder may attempt to put a
					creature to sleep after striking them with the rod, and the wielder gains three additional daily uses of their
					totem magic.</p> -->

				<h3>Savith's Swift Strike</h3>

				<p>A replica of the heroine's sword, even this impersonation of her blade is filled with the zeitgeist of an
					ancient nation. This sword is incredibly heavy, with a gray stone blade that is otherwise unremarkable, except
					for the constant light that radiates from it.</p>
				<p>This <i>+1 adamantine aberration-bane keen longsword</i> requires a DC30 strength check to hold aloft
					(reduced by 3 for each azlanti relic the person is holding, or by 5 for azlanti-blooded humans). A creature
					only needs to make this strength check once - if they fail, they cannot attempt it again until the next new
					moon. After they succeed on this strength check, the sword is weightless in their hands - otherwise, it weighs
					200lbs. Being strong enough to wield this weapon, however, does not make you automatically worthy of it. IF
					you have not become worthy of this weapon, and another creature successfully wields it, you must make the
					check to wield it anew. If you are unworthy of this weapon, you may never wield it, and automatically fail any
					checks required to wield it.</p>
				<!-- <p>Worthiness Task: ???</p> -->
				<p>Worthiness Task: Slay seven titanic monstrosities while either wielding this sword or with the sword on your
					person (not in an extradimensional space). You are unworthy of this weapon if you are evil, if you murder an
					innocent civilian, or if you flee an enemy who then kills a friend.</p>
				<p>Glory: ???</p>
				<!-- <p>Glory: The <i>Blade of the Blood Feud</i> looks shiny and deadly when properly wielded, but appears dull and
					lifeless in the hands of others. The blade becomes a <i>+2 heart-seeking ominous rival-bane machete</i>, and
					the circumstance bonus it applies on survival checks increases to +6. If the wielder begins their turn or ends
					their movement next to a dying or disabled agent employed by a rival faction, the blade forces them to spend a
					standard action to attempt a touch attack to touch the blade to the agents throat. If successful, the agent
					must make a DC17 will save or die as though slain by a <i>death knell</i> spell, and the wielder gains the
					benefits as though they cast the spell. If the wielder attempts to resist this action, they must make a DC17
					will save to drop the blade.</p> -->

				<h3>Shield of Acavna</h3>
				<picture>
					<source srcset="/serpents/images/loot-shield-acavna.webp" type="image/webp">
					<img src="/serpents/images/placeholder.png" alt="Shield of Acavna">
				</picture>
				<p>This azlanti shield contains a large moonstone in the center surrounded by bronze inlaid with gold depictions
					of crossed spears as well as the acavnan aphorism "The brave do not live forever; the cautious do not live at
					all."</p>
				<p>This <i>+2 quickdraw light bronze shield</i> is as hard as steel (but immune to rust) and is only held in the
					hand, being as easy to stow as it is to draw. This shield counts as a holy symbol of Acavna, as well as of any
					deity granted their divine spark through the starstone (namely Aroden, Iomedae, Cayden Calien, and Norberger).
				</p>
				<p>All creatures within 30 feet of a visible <i>Shield of Acavna</i> are treated as though they can see both the
					full moon and the open night's sky.
					<br>As an immediate action 1/day, the bearer may take a 5ft. step and enter the square of an ally being
					attacked to interpose themselves, forcing the attack to resolve against their touch AC instead. This must be
					done before the result of the attacker's roll is revealed. If this attack was not the result of the ally's
					movement, after resolving the attack, the ally may either spend an immediate action to take a 5ft. step into
					the bearer's former square, fall prone, or force the bearer to fall prone.
				</p>
				<!-- <p>Worthiness Task: ??</p> -->
				<p>Worthiness Task: Interpose yourself on behalf of an ally using the <i>Shield of Acavna</i> against an attack
					that was a critical threat, which deals enough damage to you that it subjects you to massive damage and would
					have killed them outright. This may make you worthy even if it kills you, though you would still be dead. If
					you ever murder a helpless innocent, you stop being worthy of this item and can never become worthy of it.</p>
				<!-- <p>Glory: Further powers of the <i>Shield of Acavna</i> will be revealed when it is wielded by someone worthy of
					it.</p> -->
				<p>Glory: The <i>Shield of Acavna's</i> enhancement bonus increases to +4, and it grants energy resistance 10
					against an element of the bearers choice (default is cold). The bearer may attune to a different element by
					offering a prayer to acavna as a 1-minute action. Additionally, when they use the shield to interpose
					themselves, they may move up to half their movement speed instead of taking a 5ft step. This movement provokes
					attacks of opportunity as normal.
					<br>Once per day as a standard action, the bearer can emit a 30' aura of protection for 1 minute, granting all
					allied creatures within the aura a +4 deflection bonus to AC and energy resistance 10 vs the attuned element.
					During this time, and for 1 hour after, the shield loses its enhancement bonus to AC and does not provide
					energy resistance to its bearer.

				<h3>Seaspike</h3>
				<picture>
					<source srcset="/serpents/images/loot-seaspike.webp" type="image/webp">
					<img src="/serpents/images/placeholder.png" alt="Seaspike">
				</picture>
				<p>This elegant, short-hafted trident appears to be made from razor-sharp coral. A jade serpent wraps around the
					haft of the weapon before being impaled on the haft's spiked foot.</p>
				<p><i>Seaspike</i> is treated as a light weapon for the purposes of Weapon Finesse and other similar abilities,
					and may be wielded as either a trident or a shortspear with the <i>+1 animal bane</i> special abilities. If a
					monstrous humanoid attempts to wield <i>Seaspike</i>, they automatically drop the weapon at the end of their
					turn.
				</p>
				<p>Last, the wielder of <i>Seaspike</i> gains a bonus to fortitude saving throws against poison equal to twice
					the weapons enhancement bonus.</p>
				<!-- <p>Worthiness Task: ??</p> -->
				<p>Worthiness Task: The wielder must recover from three different poisons while holding this weapon, without
					other aid. Intentionally exposing themselves to poison does not apply for this ability. If the wielder ever
					uses poison against another, they become unworthy of <i>Seaspike</i>.</p>
				<!-- <p>Glory: Further powers of <i>Seaspike</i> will be revealed when it is wielded by someone worthy of it.</p> -->
				<p>Glory: <i>Seaspike's</i> enhancement bonus increases to +3, and its bane special quality also applies against
					any serpent, including serpentine monstrous humanoids and magical beasts (at the GM's discretion).
					<br> As a standard action, the wielder may attempt a single melee or thrown ranged attack with seaspike to
					embed their weapon in their target. If this special attack hits, in addition to doing normal damage, the
					target must make a reflex save with a DC = 10 + the amount the attack roll exceeded the targets AC. If they
					fail, they become entangled by the weapon. If the target is a serpentine creature, they also take a penalty to
					natural attacks equal to Seaspike's effective enhancement bonus until the weapon is removed.
					<br>Special: If the wielder has vital strike, this special attack action counts as vital strike.
