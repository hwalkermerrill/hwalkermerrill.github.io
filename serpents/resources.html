						&nbsp;“The Guide informed us that the totems were not for sale, but Telgen was not dissuaded. 'Do you have
						any idea how much these would sell for in Oppara?' he asked, moon face gleaming under that ridiculous hat. I
						reminded him that, unlike his own people, the villagers might not be interested in selling off their
						ancestors for a handful of beads. He let the matter drop, but several miles later, he opened his bag to
						reveal three of the squat, grimacing carvings. Disgusted, our guide abandoned us, and we made camp.
						<br><br>&nbsp;"That night, Telgen took the ten. When we opened the flap next morning, he and the idols were
						gone. In his place was a flurry of bloody footsteps leading into the jungle - each just an inch long"

		<h2>Artifacts</h2>
		<strong>Among the most powerful objects in existence, these often-unique magic items cannot be created by mortal
			means and are not easily destroyed.</strong>
		<p>While you have found no artifacts yet, do not be discouraged - most never set eyes on one in their lifetime.</p>

		<h2>Relics and Legacies</h2>
		<strong>Occupying a space somewhere between artifacts and magical items, relics are powered by Zeitgeist.</strong>
		<p>Each relic was once a typical magic item that played a central role in a massively important event, increasing
			dramatically in potency as it drew power from its shaping of fate. As relics fade into obscurity and stories of
			them cease to be told, they wane in both power and potency. Typically, to restore a Relic to its full majesty, it
			must be used to accomplish a number of triumphs as stories are told of it anew. However, certain relics may be
			reawakened to its former glory by being used to fight the same evils they once faced while being wielded by one
			who is worthy of it.</p>
		<p>The bearer does not need to know how to become worthy of a relic to reawaken it to its glory, but they always
			must be wielding the item when they accomplish its prescribed worthiness task. A reawakened relic only manifests
			its full glory to those who are worthy of it. Spellcraft may be used to identify the worthiness task in the same
			manner as determining an items curse (typically DC 25+CL).</p>

				<h3>Blade of the Blood Feud</h3>
				<picture>
					<source srcset="/serpents/images/loot-bane-machete.webp" type="image/webp">
					<img src="/serpents/images/placeholder.png" alt="Blade of the Blood Feud">
				</picture>
				<p>First recovered by Sharrowsmith from an old dwarven mine, this dull looking machete is with the seal of a
					long-dead dwarven clan and lies ready to draw blood in service to an ancient design. It's steel doesn't lend
					itself to either polish or the grindstone, as if the blade deliberately wants to look non-threatening. </p>
				<p>This <i>+1 rival-bane machete</i> applies the bane property against agents directly employed by a rival
					faction. To qualify as a rival faction, the leaders of both factions must acknowledge the other as a bitter
					blood-rival and a threat, with a direct financial incentive to eliminating the competitor; merely desiring the
					destruction of one-another is not enough. Additionally, this blade provides a +2 circumstance bonus on all
					survival checks, instead of the normal +1 on checks to get along in the wild.</p>
				<p>Worthiness Task: ???</p>
				<p>Worthiness Task: Eliminate a rival leader with an ironic fate worse than death.</p>
				<!-- <p>Glory: The <i>Blade of the Blood Feud</i> looks shiny and deadly when properly wielded, but appears dull and
					lifeless in the hands of others. The blade becomes a <i>+2 heart-seeking ominous rival-bane machete</i>, and
					the circumstance bonus it applies on survival checks increases to +6. If the wielder begins their turn or ends
					their movement next to a dying or disabled agent employed by a rival faction, the blade forces them to spend a
					standard action to attempt a touch attack to touch the blade to the agents throat. If successful, the agent
					must make a DC17 will save or die as though slain by a <i>death knell</i> spell, and the wielder gains the
					benefits as though they cast the spell. If the wielder attempts to resist this action, they must make a DC17
					will save to drop the blade.</p> -->

				<h3>Shield of Acavna</h3>
				<picture>
					<source srcset="/serpents/images/loot-shield-acavna.webp" type="image/webp">
					<img src="/serpents/images/placeholder.png" alt="Shield of Acavna">
				</picture>
				<p>This azlanti shield contains a large moonstone in the center surrounded by bronze inlaid with gold depictions
					of crossed spears as well as the acavnan aphorism "The brave do not live forever; the cautious do not live at
					all."</p>
				<p>This <i>+2 quickdraw light bronze shield</i> is as hard as steel (but immune to rust) and is only held in the
					hand, being as easy to stow as it is to draw. This shield counts as a holy symbol of Acavna, as well as of any
					deity granted their divine spark through the starstone (namely Aroden, Iomedae, Cayden Calien, and Norberger).
				</p>
				<p>All creatures within 30 feet of a visible <i>Shield of Acavna</i> are treated as though they can see both the
					full moon and the open night's sky.
					<br>As an immediate action 1/day, the bearer may take a 5ft. step and enter the square of an ally being
					attacked to interpose themselves, forcing the attack to resolve against their touch AC instead. This must be
					done before the result of the attacker's roll is revealed. If this attack was not the result of the ally's
					movement, after resolving the attack, the ally may either spend an immediate action to take a 5ft. step into
					the bearer's former square, fall prone, or force the bearer to fall prone.
				</p>
				<!-- <p>Worthiness Task: ??</p> -->
				<p>Worthiness Task: Interpose yourself on behalf of an ally using the <i>Shield of Acavna</i> against an attack
					that was a critical threat, which deals enough damage to you that it subjects you to massive damage and would
					have killed them outright. This may make you worthy even if it kills you, though you would still be dead. If
					you ever murder a helpless innocent, you stop being worthy of this item and can never become worthy of it.</p>
				<p>Glory: Further powers of the <i>Shield of Acavna</i> will be revealed when it is wielded by someone worthy of
					it.</p>
				<!-- <p>Glory: The <i>Shield of Acavna's</i> enhancement bonus increases to +4, and it grants energy resistance 10
					against an element of the bearers choice (default is cold). The bearer may attune to a different element by
					offering a prayer to acavna as a 1-minute action. Additionally, when they use the shield to interpose
					themselves, they may move up to half their movement speed instead of taking a 5ft step. This movement provokes
					attacks of opportunity as normal.
					<br>Once per day as a standard action, the bearer can emit a 30' aura of protection for 1 minute, granting all
					allied creatures within the aura a +4 deflection bonus to AC and energy resistance 10 vs the attuned element.
					During this time, and for 1 hour after, the shield loses its enhancement bonus to AC and does not provide
					energy resistance to its bearer.

				<h3>Seaspike</h3>
				<picture>
					<source srcset="/serpents/images/loot-seaspike.webp" type="image/webp">
					<img src="/serpents/images/placeholder.png" alt="Seaspike">
				</picture>
				<p>This elegant, short-hafted trident appears to be made from razor-sharp coral. A jade serpent wraps around the
					haft of the weapon before being impaled on the haft's spiked foot.</p>
				<p><i>Seaspike</i> is treated as a light weapon for the purposes of Weapon Finesse and other similar abilities,
					and may be wielded as either a trident or a shortspear with the <i>+1 animal bane</i> special abilities. If a
					monstrous humanoid attempts to wield <i>Seaspike</i>, they automatically drop the weapon at the end of their
					turn.
				</p>
				<p>Last, the wielder of <i>Seaspike</i> gains a bonus to fortitude saving throws against poison equal to twice
					the weapons enhancement bonus.</p>
				<!-- <p>Worthiness Task: ??</p> -->
				<p>Worthiness Task: The wielder must recover from three different poisons while holding this weapon, without
					other aid. Intentionally exposing themselves to poison does not apply for this ability. If the wielder ever
					uses poison against another, they become unworthy of <i>Seaspike</i>.</p>
				<!-- <p>Glory: Further powers of <i>Seaspike</i> will be revealed when it is wielded by someone worthy of it.</p> -->
				<p>Glory: <i>Seaspike's</i> enhancement bonus increases to +3, and its bane special quality also applies against
					any serpent, including serpentine monstrous humanoids and magical beasts (at the GM's discretion).
					<br> As a standard action, the wielder may attempt a single melee or thrown ranged attack with seaspike to
					embed their weapon in their target. If this special attack hits, in addition to doing normal damage, the
					target must make a reflex save with a DC = 10 + the amount the attack roll exceeded the targets AC. If they
					fail, they become entangled by the weapon. If the target is a serpentine creature, they also take a penalty to
					natural attacks equal to Seaspike's effective enhancement bonus until the weapon is removed.
					<br>Special: If the wielder has vital strike, this special attack action counts as vital strike.
