        <h3>
          <i>
            &nbsp;"In the trader's tongue of certain Mwangi tribes, 'Charau' literally translates as 'Beware.' It is a cry of alarm, a shout raised when a village catches fire or a flash flood strikes. A word shouted by guards when they spot the enemy. The 'Charau-Ka,' then, are the watch out people, the foes who lurk always in the forest/ Charau-Ka! Beware Them!
            <br>&nbsp;"But did the Charau-Ka get their name from the word for danger? Or is the ape-men's name for themselves instead the root of the word? Only the jungle knows; and the jungle keeps its secrets."
          </i>
          <br>&emsp; —  Jalus Ebincott, Professor of Mwangi Studies, Almas University.

    <div>
      <h2>Step 1: Consult the Players Guide</h2>
      <h3>The players guide contains many details regarding the campaign and is a great resource specifically for planning your character. Many topics in the following sections refer to the players guide or contain excerpts from the players guide. While you do not need to read the entire guide, it is recommended to read as much of it as you can, or at least open a copy of it while creating your character, to make referencing easier.</h3>
      <p>A copy of the players guide may be found <a href="/serpents/attachments/players-guide.pdf">HERE</a>.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Step 2: Choose a Class</h2>
      <h3>Get an idea for the kind of character you want to play. Magic or Melee? Tactical or Straight Forward? Highly Skilled or Powerful? Team Oriented or Loner? Choosing a class is the first step in building your character.</h3>
      <p>While Sargava and the Mwangi Expanse play host to some classes more easily than others, members of all types have reason to journey to the region on the <i>Jenivere</i>. Be they natives to the land returning home from travels abroad or foreigners venturing into uncharted territory for the first time, characters of any class can play an important role in the Serpent’s Skull Adventure Path. </p>
      <p>There are no restrictions on classes in this campaign, though the Players Guide has some advice. Classes that rely on a certain degree of stable infrastructure, especially urban-focused classes and archetypes, may have a harder time through significant portions of this adventure. Characters with some ability to navigate effectively or have the ability to travel faster will find practical applications for their skills frequently.</p>      
      <p>The information below and in the players guide also contains recommendations for inspirations on how to play different classes in the Mwangi Expanse, as well as some archetypes thematic to this campaign.</p>
      <p>For more information on classes generally, visit <a href=www.d20pfsrd.com/classes>pfsrd.com</a> or <a href=www.aonprd.com>aonprd.com</a></p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Step 3: Rolling Stats</h2>
      <h3>Stat rolls must be done in person with the GM, so they will not be detailed heavily here. Depending on stats, the chosen character concept and class may need to be tweaked. If the stats rolled are not to the players liking, they may choose to default to a 15-point buy.</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Step 4: Filling in the Character</h2>
      <h3>Every character has elements of the following. Click on each section as needed to expand the details. It is HIGHLY recommended to view each section in order, even if your an experienced player, as they each contain critical information for this campaign.</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="asset">
      <section>
        <h3>Race</h3>
        <img src="/serpents/images/creation-races.jpg" alt="Races">
        <p>Races for this campaign are partially restricted, and may be selected from the lists of races that are <b>Either Foreign or Native</b>, <b>Foreign Only</b>, or <b>Native Only</b>. While anyone may play as a race that is listed as <b>Either Foreign or Native</b> or <b>Native Only</b>, the races listed as <b>Foreign Only</b> may only be played one time (by any player) during the campaign. More races will be added to the <b>Native Only</b> list as they are unlocked throughout the campaign.</p>
        <p>Additionally, players must choose if they are a foreigner (including colonists born in Sargava), or a Mwangi native. Along with narrowing down race options, this choice affects how you perceive (and are perceived by) certain groups. If you choose to play as a native race that normally starts with common as a language known, you start with polyglot instead. If you choose play a race that does not start speaking common, your character must learn common or polyglot prior to joining the party.</p>
        <p>Finally, alternate racial traits represent a unique heritage. Up to one alternate racial trait may be chosen, but no more than one. Races marked with a (*) have a note regarding their abilities.</p>
        <ul>Race Options are as follows:
          <li><b>Either Foreign or Native</b>: Catfolk, Dwarf, Elf, Half-Elf, Human, Kobold(*), Lizardfolk, Oread, Skinwalker (any), Tiefling, and Undine. If you chose to play as a human, please also choose your ethnicity (or tribe if you're a native).</li>
          <li><b>Foreign Only</b>: Aasimar, Changeling, Dhampir, Gnome, Halfling, Half-Orc, Ifrit, Locathah, Ratfolk, Strix, Suli, Sylph, and Tengu.</li>
          <li><b>Native Only</b>: Grippli(*)</p>
        <!-- <li><b>Locked Native Races</b>: Gnoll, Gnomae, Halfling (song'o), Hobgoblin, Monkey Goblin, Orc, Vanara, Vine Leshy, and Vishkanya.</li> -->
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Archetypes</h3>
        <img src="/serpents/images/creation-archetypes.jpg" alt="Archetypes">
        <p>Archetypes provide a way to tailor a chosen class to better fit the desired playstyle. Archetypes that focus on exploration and overland travel, facilitate item acquisitions, specializing in combating animals and magical beats, or increase skill versatility will be particularly useful throughout most of the campaign. Also, any archetypes dealing with or improving Animal Companions, Juju, Totems, or Spiritualism will find they are particularly thematic.</p>
        <ul>While the players guide does not make suggestions regarding potential archetypes, some suggestions towards tailoring your character towards this campaign include:
          <li>Arcanist: Magaambyan Initiate</li>
          <li>Barbarian: <b>(any) Totem Warrior</b>, Jungle Ranger, Mad Dog, Scarred Rager, Wildborn</li>

          <li>Vampire Hunter: Shadow Hunter, Tomb Hunter</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Alignment</h3>
        <img src="/serpents/images/creation-alignment.jpg" alt="Alignment Chart">
        <p>Every character must have an alignment, showing their outlook on ethics and morality respectively. Each character must be either Lawful, Chaotic or Neutral ethically and either Good, Evil, or Neutral morally. If you have a hard time understanding these alignments, please consult your GM.</p>
        <p>The Lost Colony of Sargava (the central location for this campaign) is Neutral Good, so characters who are Neutral Good or their immediate neighbors, (any) Good and True Neutral, are the most common alignments and characters of these alignments will be most at home throughout this campaign. Lawful Neutral and Chaotic Neutral characters in particular should be cautious not to get on the sour-side of certain NPCs, potentially locking the party into certain story paths which may not lead to the desired ending. Lawful Evil and True Evil (neutral evil) is only permitted in this campaign if your character has a method of disguising it. Chaotic Evil is prohibited.</p>
        <p>The motivations of the player characters by the adventures beginning may be varied, but they should generally be seeking adventure and treasure, not necessarily to make themselves rich - they may of course be altruistic - but the sense of wonder in discovery should be part of their personality.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Campaign Trait</h3>
        <img src="/serpents/images/creation-traits.jpg" alt="Campaign Trait">
        <p>Every player gets two traits during character creation. Players may take a drawback trait to get up to one extra trait (total of three). One of these traits must be used to select a campaign trait, which ties the character into the area and serves throughout the campaign. No player may have more than one campaign trait, but unlike many other campaigns, there is no limit to how many players select any one particular campaign trait.</p>
        <p>Campaign traits are detailed in the player's guide and further expanded upon in the explorers tab, so they will not be detailed here.</p>
        <p>Jungle Fighter and Two-World Magic are both traits that were designed with this campaign in mind and are highly recommended. Other thematic traits include: Citizen of Eleder, Citizen of Kalabuto, Faithful Arodenite, Hill Fighter, Jungle Guide (Sargava), River Fighter, Sargavan Guard, Spirit Talker, and any of the racial traits of the Mwangi people.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Religious Views</h3>
        <img src="/serpents/images/creation-religion.jpg" alt="Religion">
        <p>Gods know no borders, and the natural barriers and vast distances of the Expanse has shaped its religions as much as its people, creating a thousand variants comprised of familiar deities, region faiths, and practices both spiritual and occult. Some of the first colonists in Sagave were missionaries from the Inner sea, who found their greatest successes convincing the native population that their form of worship was to the same deities under different names, with many of the inner sea faiths have culturally blended with ancient local beliefs. Yet the gods are also very real, and the prevalence of the supernatural is proof of the divine and its influence. As such, while the form of everyone's beliefs and worship may differ, and no one is required to choose a patron deity or pantheon, it is highly recommended.</p>
        <p>Regarding faiths of the Inner Sea, <b>Aroden</b> is still the state patron of Sargava, which has generally become synonymous with the worship of <b>Iomedae</b> (sometimes known locally as "The Warrior Chief") since his disappearance. Other commonly observed Inner Sea faiths include <b>Abadar</b> ("The Wealthy Father"), <b>Shelyn</b> ("The Beautiful Lady"), and both <b>Gozreh and Desna</b> as one deity known as <b>Shimye-Magalla</b> who exclusively reflects the female aspect of Gozreh and has been worshipped by the Mwangi "since the wind began to blow, the rain began to fall, and the people began to dream." <b>The Green Faith</b> has many adherents in the jungles of the expanse, as nature worship is both widespread and non-specific. Also, with all the monsters that fill the Expanse, the fearful worship of <b>Lamastu</b> is widespread, even if it goes by different names, as all Mwangi fears the "Mother of Monsters." While many other Inner Sea faiths are found throughout the expanse, most prominently the worship of <b>Erastil</b> and <b>Pharasma</b>, these faiths lack any major centers of worship or missionary work.</p>
        <p>Mwangi faiths that have not merged with colonial ones include the worship of <b>Angazhan, Balumbdar, Chohar, Grandmother Spider, Kalekot, Lubaiko, Luhar, Mazludeh, Tlehar, Uvuko,</b> and <b>Walkena</b>. Ancestor worship, Shamanism, Totemism, and Juju practices are prevalent throughout the Expanse - often existing alongside other belief systems. Despite being dead since before Earthfall, there are also many depictions of Ydersius throughout the ruins found in the jungles of the Expanse, and while clearly a monster and an enemy to all mankind, it does have its adherents. Similarly, there are many depictions of Ancient Azlanti and Shori faiths, though most of these have either been adapted in the turnings of millennia or simply been lost to time. Finally, the local Dwarven and Elven religions still worship much the same deities as those in the inner sea, having both longer lifespans and less separation than the humans have had, though there are still many subtle distinctions and local cultural alterations of those faiths compared to their inner-sea counterparts.</p>
        <p>There are countless other faiths practiced both publicly and privately by both native Mwangi peoples and explorers from all across the inner sea, and as such, there are plenty of reasons to choose to worship a faith that is not listed here, but it will likely not have strong representation through this campaign, and thereby may not be the best choice if you are seeking</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Feats</h3>
        <img src="/serpents/images/creation-feats.jpg" alt="Feats">
        <p>Every player gets one feat at first level, and every odd numbered level thereafter. They may also get bonus feats from their classes, race, or archetypes.</p>
        <p>PC's are recommended to dedicate themselves to one or more combat feat trees. Much of the campaign will also take place within ruins or the jungle, so feats that enable easier movement in difficult terrain, crafting of items, protecting campsites, setting traps, or general survival feats would all be useful. The party will also have an easier time if at least one member of the party focuses on knowledge and social abilities respectively. Ranged attacks will frequently run into targets with cover, and will need to invest heavily in their preferred combat style.</p>
        <p>This campaign uses the Elephant in the Room feat system, which primarily eliminates feat taxes by merging certain feats while making other essentially free (most notably power attack). For more information on feat changes and merges, please refer to the table rules section or consult your GM.</p>
        <p>Any unlocked feats that are free to all characters will appear here in the future.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Skills</h3>
        <img src="/serpents/images/creation-skills.jpg" alt="Skills">
        <p>This campaign has an <i>Exploration - Survival</i> theme and likewise has a great deal of emphasis on identifying and surviving threats or otherwise mitigating them, as well as on both social and physical challenges that cannot be simply overcome with combat. Time will also be plentiful, but precious, in this campaign, with a calendar counting every day since the <i>Jenivere</i> first set sail to the end of the campaign, and many challenges are easier if encountered - and overcome - sooner.</p>
        <p>Perception is always useful, and the classic adventuring standbys of Disable Device, Spellcraft, Stealth, and Survival will all have moments to shine. Players will also be confronted with physical challenges which require all individuals to use Acrobatics, Climb, Ride, and Swim skills. There will also be social challenges that are made much easier with the use of social skills, particularly Diplomacy, but Bluff, Intimidate, and Sense Motive will also prove essential in certain instances. Players will also find a diversity of Knowledge skills useful, particularly Dungeoneering and Nature, as well as Arcana, Geography, History, Local, Religion, and Planes. While no skill is ever useless, players may want to ensure that at least one person in the party has these skills covered before investing too heavily in other pursuits.</p>
        <p>Finally, this campaign will utilize the Background Skills system from pathfinder unchained, which grants everyone 2 skill points that they can only spend in background skills at each level regardless of intelligence, though regular points may be spent in background skills as well. Everyone must spend at least 1 background point in a craft, perform, or profession skill of their to represent how they made money before becoming an adventurer. For more information on background skills, read pathfinder unchained skill systems, or consult your GM.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Equipment</h3>
        <img src="/serpents/images/creation-equipment.jpg" alt="Equipment">
        <p>Equipment is an important part of every character. Each player has a certain amount of starting gold, determined by their class, with which to buy items. For this particular campaign, all players must choose average starting wealth.</p>
        <p>Players may buy anything they'd like that they can afford, though they cannot spend more than half of their starting wealth on any one item. Characters joining the game after level 1 will join with 70% of the wealth-by-level, to account for items already collected by the party.</p>
        <p><b>Notice!</b> The colony of Sargava maintains its protection payments to the Hurricane King and funding for city services primarily with brutal tariffs on imports, leading to both increased prices on items and on widespread smuggling. Generally speaking, prices in Sargava are 10-25% higher than elsewhere across the inner sea, without improving the sale price of those items. This makes acquiring items generally more expensive, unless it is either smuggled (for its own premium) or locally sourced. Characters created locally after level 1 will need to pay these higher prices for their starting equipment.</p> 
        <p>As this is an <i>Exploration - Survival</i> campaign, equipment that you find will occasionally be cursed, damaged or difficult to sell, opportunities to buy/sell will be frequently limited (along with merchant inventory), and prices on items may vary widely depending on where and how it was acquired. Conversely, however, there will be ample time to rest and craft, and clever (and lucky) players may take advantage of price fluctuations to transport trade goods and valuables from places where their value is low to places where they are worth much more - provided they're willing and able to take on such risks. Classes that rely on ready access to items (like ammunition or spell components) or specific magic items (like wands) will have a harder time in this campaign, but characters with abilities that make crafting or acquiring such things easier (such as methods of foraging, black market connections, or craft magical arms and armor) will have a much easier time, especially at lower levels. At a minimum, it would be wise for at least one person in the party to know how to find (and cook) food, how to heal, and how to repair equipment.</p>
      </section>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Step 5: Background</h2>
      <h3>Your character’s background represents who they were before they joined the party.</h3>
      <p>Remember that while making something wholely original is nearly impossible, everyone is unique. When brainstorming, it sometimes helps to reject the first two ideas that leap to mind and choose the third, fourth, or fifth instead - challenging yourself to explore wider and more interesting possibilities. If you feel like your character is boring or stereotypical, choose something about them that is opposite what you might expect, like a dwarven fighter with a vow against alcohol, can't grow a beard, or grew up on an island. Finally, <b>Steal Shamelessly;</b> sometimes you just need a good foundation from something you already love. Your backstory may be extensive or brief, convoluted or by-the-numbers, but it forms the foundation for how you roleplay your character and helps you determine how much you want to share with the rest of the party, keep between you and the GM, or keep private.</p>
      <p><b>Two Quirks and a Flaw!</b> If you’re pressed for time or you’re looking to create the basics of a character as simply as possible, establish the essence of your personality by thinking of two quirks and a flaw. Quirks are specific attributes of your personality or psyche: character traits, compulsions, eccentricities, or uncommon physical features. These shouldn’t be commonplace or mundane. “Tall” is a poor one, but “too big for my body” could be great. “Charismatic” is weak, but “flirts with nearly everybody I meet” is specific and actionable. “Homebody” is not as good a quirk as “feels tired, uncomfortable, and hungry away from home.” </p>
      <p>Add a flaw the same way. Instead of merely being “arrogant,” maybe you “believe I’m smarter than anyone I know.” Perhaps you’re not so much “proud” as “afraid of being wrong and looking stupid.” Rather than “greedy,” you may be “terrified of dying poor and hungry.” </p>
      <p>When you choose an attribute or trait to use as a quirk or flaw, you can dig deeper into the concept by asking yourself how and why. If you’re shy, how shy are you? So shy that you can never look anyone directly in the eye? If you’re paranoid, why are you paranoid? Maybe everyone you’ve ever trusted betrayed you? Homing in on desires and fears will help answer those questions.</p>
      <p>You can also feel free to use a background generator, rolling and rerolling until you come up with a jumping-off point you find interesting. On the otherhand, if your looking for a deep dive, feel free to check out <a href="attachments/uc-character-background.pdf">Writing a Character Background</a> from Ultimate Campaigns.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Step 6: Share your Profile</h2>
      <h3>Send to the party a summary of the public information of your character, which will go on to be posted on the website for other players to see and put a face to your character.</h3>
      <p>The portion you share publicly with the party from the start should include a short paragraph describing your appearance and backstory, as well as your race, class (and levels), campaign trait, and a portrait of you (or what the party presumes of you). If you are keeping secrets from the party, it is usually a good idea to share those secrets with the GM. Your portrait should be tasteful, needs to be shared via its original link for best copy (not just a messenger download), and is preferably on a white background, though that is not required.</p>
      <p>Additionally, this campaign requires you to disclose if you are a Colonial or a Mwangi native, what your divine patron is (if any/ public), and you must choose a spirit totem as outlined in your campaign trait. The campaign trait section provides examples of specific totems that fit the criteria outlined. You should not pick a totem that completely matches another totem that has already been chosen (same descriptor and animal).</p>
      <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">Lastly, please include the following in your social profile, which may all evolve or change over the course of the game.
        <li>Aspirations - At least one, but preferably two or three clearly actionable goals, which have an obvious and reachable end-point.</li>
        <li>Anathema - One action that you cannot abide - you will never do them or tolerate it happening. The antithesis of who you are and what you stand for.</li>
        <li>Phobias - At least one tangible fear.</li>
        <li>Quirks - At least two things about your character that stands out (see Two Quirks and a Flaw).</li>
        <li>Flaw - Something that is holding you back or ocasionally causes you to either make imperfect or unreliable choices.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Step 7: Finalization</h2>
      <h3>Please audit your character to make sure nothing has been forgotten. It may be wise to check your character sheet with the GM. Also, check with your GM if anything is confusing, if you need help with any of these steps, or if you are concerned about how something in your character build may interact with the campaign world or the party.</h3>
      <p>Your characters personality and familial details will also be important and need to be determined before the commencement of the campaign. Work with your GM to plan these, but understand that most characters will probably need: Likes, Dislikes, Fears, Aspirations, Parents, Parental Relationship, and Close Relationship Details such as information regarding a current or former spouse, sibling, or child.</p>
      <p>Double check your character, and make sure you know how your character fits in the community (whether or not they already know the other players). Whether they were raised here, are temporarily stationed here, came here to set up shop or find work, or thought hey were just passing through, your character should have been living in Roslar's Coffer (the starting location of the game) for at least the last year, and preferably at least the last ten years.</p>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle">Some commonly overlooked items are:</b>
        <li>Calculating skill bonus totals, base attack bonuses, total health, saving throws, and combat modifiers.</li>
        <li>Choosing Spells Known and Spells Prepped.</li>
        <li>Determining your characters height, weight, age, and carrying capacity.</li>
        <li>Double Checking that all skills and feats have been chosen and that they comply with the rules for the campaign.</li>
        <li>Saving some spending money for the beginning of the game.</li>
      </ul>
