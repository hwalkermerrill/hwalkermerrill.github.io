					<img class="pointer" src="/serpents/images/unknown.png" alt="Faction Leader Iconic Profile">
				</picture>
				<h3>Appearance</h3>
				<p>Middle aged and mildly foppish, His Honorable Lordship Vibius is a confirmed bachelor of both
					wealth and station. At all times, he is dressed impeccably and acts with decorum, though he imperiously eyes
					the jungle with a combination of fright and disgust. His nobility has afforded him a fantastic education, yet
					he retains an insatiable curiosity for the unknown, often asking pointed questions after concluding with
					pleasantries.</p>
				<h3>Background</h3>
				<p>The largest benefactor to the Gold Crown Shipping and Mining Company (G.C.S.), Earl Vibius typically pays
					them enough money to operate for a year in exchange for brief explorations of the Stasis Fields in th Bandu
					Hills, though he doesn't seem to do anything with the reports that return to him. Not a field man, he is
					funding the expedition entirely out of his own pocket, purely for the pursuit of knowledge, of course.</p>

        <h2>Leader Details: Captain Alizandru Kovack</h2>
        <p>A Chelish man whose family has made the Magnimar to Eleder run for generations, Captain Kovack is pleasant enough with his passengers, but a strict disciplinarian when dealing with his crew. </p> -->

				<h2>Action Plan: Rediscover the lost city of Saventh-Yhi (First!)</h2>
				<p>Having signed on with the Gold Crown Shipping and Mining Company (G.C.S.), the castaways from the Smuggler’s
					Shiv have found an ally in the wealthy benefactor of Earl Ortho Vibius. He is personally funding an expedition
					to Saventh-Yhi via the G.C.S. with very clear objectives. With other interested factions also en-route, it is
					imperative the G.C.S. reaches and claims Saventh-Yhi first, especially before the Rivermen's Guild (their
					longtime rival).</p>
				<p>The objectives of the expedition are uncommon. While they intend to mine out gold and artifacts from the city
					to recover the cost of the expedition, the primary goal is to find the lost Sixth Army of Exploration, who
					supposedly found Saventh-Yhi before being annihilated. This makes the recovery of their lost artifacts, and
					discovering information regarding their path and disappearance, paramount. Particularly any items or
					information involving Grand Prince Cyricas, the legendary Worldbreaker, noble explorers of the sixth army, or
					the route of the army, should be reported.</p>
				<p>The expedition is being fully outfitted and will travel roughly 1 day behind the trailblazers, with scouts
					and messengers operating in front of, around, and between the two parties.</p>
				<!-- <p>A new spiritual advisor still needs to be procured.</p> -->
				<p>Nkechi has been recruited as the spiritual advisor and guide for the expedition. While he remains with the
					main expeditionary force, he can communicate with the trailblazers via messenger pigeon's and their dreams,
					using the information he interprets from them dispatch necessary aid to the trailblazers and ensure the main
					party is traveling on the correct path.</p>
				<p>Cheiton has also been recruited as a Skipper to help the trailblazers travel up and down the waterways and
					rivers of the Expanse. While he is prone to exaggeration and force puns, he is an incredible navigator and
					frequently escorts expeditions into the heart of the jungle and always manages to bring them back, mostly
					alive.</p>
				<p></p>
				<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
					<li style="list-style-type: none;">In addition to their signing bonus, each trailblazer will also be provided
						with any of the following provisions:</li>
					<li style="list-style-type: none; display: none;">Click to reveal additional provisions:</li>
					<li>A combat-trained mount of their choice that they can ride, equipped with a masterwork saddle and
						saddle-bags. Mount options include the Horse, Camel, or Zebra (large), and the Antelope, Pony, and Ridding
						Dog (medium). Certain Mount Companions may also be provided, including the Giraffe, Hippopotamus, Lion,
						Pygmy Elephant, Rhinoceros, Tiger, or Triceratops.</li>
					<li>Explorer's gear including: An Explorer's Outfit, Bedroll, Blanket, Flint and Steel, Masterwork Backpack,
						Mess Kit,. A (one) Cooking kit, Dungeoneering Kit, Healer's Kit, Mapmaker's Kit, and large tent are also
						provided to the party.</li>
