Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.

It might be silly, but I really had a moment when I learned about exception. I kinda
knew how functions worked and I was trying to use functions instead of copy/pasting code,
but I often felt like I was spending a ton of time writing validation loops to feel like
I could get the program working under ordinary scenarios. But when I learned about
exceptions, something just clicked and I had a ton of fun learning how to use them to
troubleshoot a run or build. Even more, when I was working on my final, I was able to use
an exception so that if the wrong input was put in by the user, it corrected it to a
default input before processing, which kept my program together. Now I feel like I can
do/have done a lot with functions, and I'm trying to figure out how to write a function
to solve a problem instead of copy-pasting between points.

2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?



3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?
