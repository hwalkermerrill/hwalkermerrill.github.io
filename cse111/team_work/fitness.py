# Problem Statement:
# Health professionals who are helping a client achieve a healthy body weight,
# sometimes use two computed measures named body mass index and basal metabolic rate.
# >
# From the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention we read:
# Body mass index (BMI) is a person’s weight in kilograms divided by the square of their height in meters.
# BMI can be used to screen for weight categories such as underweight, normal, overweight, and obese that
# may lead to health problems. However, BMI is not diagnostic of the body fatness or health of an individual.
# The formula for computing BMI is:
# >  bmi = (10,000 * weight) / height2
# >  where weight is in kilograms and height is in centimeters.
# >
# Basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the minimum number of calories required daily to keep your body functioning at rest.
# BMR is different for women and men and changes with age. The revised Harris-Benedict formulas for computing BMR are:
# >  (women)  bmr = 447.593 + 9.247 * weight + 3.098 * height − 4.330 * age
# >  (men)  bmr = 88.362 + 13.397 * weight + 4.799 * height − 5.677 * age
# >  where weight is in kilograms and height is in centimeters.

# Assignment:
# Work as a team to write a Python program named fitness.py that does the following:
# Asks the user to enter four values:
# >  1. gender
# >  2. birthdate in this format: YYYY-MM-DD
# >  3. weight in U.S. pounds
# >  4. height in U.S. inches
# Converts the weight from pounds to kilograms (1 lb = 0.45359237 kg).
# Converts inches to centimeters (1 in = 2.54 cm).
# Calculates age, BMI, and BMR.
# Prints age, weight in kg, height in cm, BMI, and BMR.


# Asks user to enter information
# First part inputs and validates users biological gender
