# Problem Statement:
# Getting clean water to all buildings in a city is a large and expensive task.
# Many cities will build an elevated water tank, and install a pump that pushes water
# up to the tank where the water is stored. In the city, when a thirsty person opens
# a water faucet, water runs from the tank through pipes to the faucet. Earthâ€™s gravity
# pulling on the water in the elevated tank pressurizes the water and causes it to spray
# from the faucet.
# >
# Before a city builds a water distribution system, an engineer must design the system
# and ensure water will flow to all buildings in the city. An engineer must choose the
# tower height, pipe type, pipe diameter, and pipe path. Engineers use software to help
# them make these choices and design a working water distribution system.

# Assignment
# Write a Python program that could help an engineer design a water distribution system.
# During this prove milestone, you will write three program functions and three test
# functions as described in the Steps section below.
