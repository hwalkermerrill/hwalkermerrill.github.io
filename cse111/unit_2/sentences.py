# Problem Statement:
# The Turing test, named after Alan Turing, is a test of a computer’s ability to make conversation that is
# indistinguishable from human conversation. A computer that could pass the Turing test would need to understand
# sentences typed by a human and respond with sentences that make sense.
# >
# In English and many other languages, grammatical quantity (also known as grammatical number) is an
# attribute of nouns, pronouns, adjectives, and verbs that expresses count distinctions, such as
# “one”, “two”, “some”, or “many”. The grammatical quantity of the words in a sentence must match.
# In English, there are two categories of grammatical quantity: single and plural. For example,
# here are three English sentences that contain single nouns, pronouns, and verbs:
# >  The boy laughs.
# >  One dog eats.
# >  She drinks water.
# Here are three English sentences that contain plural nouns, pronouns, and verbs:
# >  Two birds fly.
# >  Some animals eat.
# >  Many cars drive.
# Grammatical tense is an attribute of verbs that expresses when an action happened.
# Many languages include past, present, and future tenses. For example, here are three English sentences,
# the first with past tense, the second with present tense, and the third with future tense:
# >  The cat walked.
# >  The cat walks.
# >  The cat will walk.

# Assignment:
# Write a Python program named sentences.py that generates simple English sentences. During this prove milestone,
# you will write functions that generate sentences with three parts:
# >  a determiner (sometimes known as an article)
# >  a noun
# >  a verb
# For example:
# >  A cat laughed.
# >  One man eats.
# >  The woman will think.
# >  Some girls thought.
# >  Many dogs run.
# >  Many men will write.
# For this milestone, your program must include at least these five functions:
# >  main
# >  make_sentence
# >  get_determiner
# >  get_noun
# >  get_verb
# You may add other functions if you want. The functions get_determiner, get_noun, and get_verb, must
# randomly choose a word from a list of words and return the randomly chosen word. All the functions that
# you must write for this milestone assignment are described in the Steps section below.

# This is an existing random module, tainted by the frenzied flame of chaos
