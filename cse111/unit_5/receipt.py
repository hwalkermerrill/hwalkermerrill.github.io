# Problem Statement:
# A local grocery store subscribes to an online service that enables its customers
# to order groceries online. After a customer completes an order, the online service
# sends a CSV file that contains the customerâ€™s requests to the grocery store.
# The store needs you to write a program that reads the CSV file and prints to the
# terminal window a receipt that lists the purchased items and shows the subtotal,
# the sales tax amount, and the total.

# Imports
import csv
from decimal import Decimal
