"""
When you physically exercise to strengthen your heart, you
should maintain your heart rate within a range for at least 20
minutes. To find that range, subtract your age from 220. This
difference is your maximum heart rate per minute. Your heart
simply will not beat faster than this maximum (220 - age).
When exercising to strengthen your heart, you should keep your
heart rate between 65% and 85% of your heartâ€™s maximum rate.

# This program ask's the user for their age and then calculates and prints their target exercise heart rate.

# This uses int(input()) instead of input() so user's input is stored as a number instead of a string. Not doing this means it can't math correctly.
# age = int(input("Please enter your age: "))

# This is a more fun and self-validating way to get the user's age. If they do not enter a number, it will ask for a number until they do.
